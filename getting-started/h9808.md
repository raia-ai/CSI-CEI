# File Management and Conversion

### Convert item data

Item data stored using Finglow Software prior to the March 2020 release will need to be converted into the new file format. From the **File** menu select **Convert item data** , the dialog shown below will then be displayed. ![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/FlatFileConvFolder.png) For information regarding converting EFP Sheets see - [Converting SEF files](../h9701.htm#0300) There are two different ways the software can display the users data - see Folders or Drives view Using either the Folders or Drives view navigate to the existing projects. Double clicking on a Project which will display a list of existing Items created using the **1902** or earlier version of the software, these Items can then be converted. The new converted file will be named _\[Project name]Item name_ and will be saved in the top level of the existing DTA folder. For example the file shown above with be saved as **C:\dta test\\\[Demo project]V-123 Vertical Vessel** and will have the extenstion **.F3D** for Items converted using Finglow 3D and **.F2D** for Items converted using Finglow 2D. When an Item has been converted a **Y** will be displayed next to that Item under the column header **OK**. Because the new file format is no longer an index based system the user is reminded that file descriptions now have to comply with normal system [File name conventions](../h9808.htm#0600). NOTE: All files assosiated with the Item will be converted, so this will only have to be done once for each Item.
