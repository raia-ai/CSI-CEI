If the details are incorrect, press the _Edit data_ button to edit the revision status and client details as described in Edit Client and Revision History Data.
Press the _OK_ button to continue. After selecting the required printer the Print preview screen will be displayed, from here the entire document can be previewed before printing.
The printed output includes a Title page, an Index and a Revision History. Each page is numbered and includes the Item description, the Client's name, the Document number and Issue, the Calculation description, the Design Code, the Program title and version number, the Operator's initials and the Date when the calculation was performed.
**NOTE:** The print to Fabrication Manager option allows the user to export data to _Fabrication Manager_ \- see www.thinkcei.com
## Edit Client and Revision History Data
An important facility provided by the Finglow Software is its ability to maintain a revision history file for complete sets of calculations. This revision history is printed in front of the calculation data sheets. Each line of the revision history contains the issue number or letter, a description of the issue, the date and operator ID. This option is also used to enter any client details, this information is printed on the cover sheet of the printed report. The _Client_ and _Doc No._ are also printed at the top of each report page.

The client details input fields are all text fields and may consist of letters, numbers and other characters.
If the _Notes reqd ?_ option is set to **Yes** , explanatory notes for each type of calculation will printed at the start of each section.
Issue numbers are not generated automatically by the system and, prior to initial printout, the character ? in place of the issue number and the description _Preliminary issue_ are established by default. This enables a check print to be produced and any necessary corrections made before printing the first issue.
NOTE : The Issue number should be updated before the first official printout of the calculations is made.
Type in a single number or letter for the _Next Issue_ and then enter the _Description_ of the issue \(e.g. Issued for comments\). 
NOTE: For QA purposes, once entered it is not possible to edit the description of a previous issue number.
Press the _OK_ button to save the data entered, or the _Cancel_ button to abort without saving any changes.
The _Reset_ button will allow the user to delete the entire revison history and ,optionally, all existing print files.
