# Importing a DesignCalcs Model

The software has the ability to import a CEI DesignCalcs Model into Finglow 3D. From the **File** menu select **Import DC Model** , the dialog shown below will then be displayed. ![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/impDCFile.png) Navigate to the location of the DesignCalcs file, select the required file and click the **Import** button, the dialog shown below will then be displayed. ![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/impDCFile2.png) Navigate to the location for the destination Finglow file, then either select a file to overwrite, or click the **New item** check box and type a new description into the edit box. Then click the **Import** button, the software will then proceed to import the file.

## Messages

As the import progresses a series of warning messages will be displayed, depending on the components that are being imported. These messages will also be written to a file called **Import.txt** , which is located in the same directory as the destination Finglow file. This file will consist of some of the following messages. **NOTE: In general the component name in question will also be displayed at the beginning of these messages.**

| Added shell to nozzle - check projection                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Finglow doesn't allow a nozzle to be attached to another nozzle, so if this occurs the software will add a piece of shell to the parent nozzle, of which the location of the weld will need to be edited.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

If this is the case then there is no need to add them separately as an additional load, so the additional load can be deleted.                                                                                |

## Additional Information

Finglow software has a very comprehensive inbuilt dimensional checking facility to make sure components fit together, so some components that are imported may not be valid in Finglow and will need further dimensional adjustment. These components will be greyed out and will display an error message in the tooltips when hovered over in the component tree control. These will have to be corrected before any calculations can be performed. If an Appendix 2 flange is imported that doesn't have a mating flange, a blind flange will be added in order for Finglow to run a calculation, the mating flange can be ignored. When importing Tubesheet data, the **Conditions** data will not be transferred. This data can be input by clicking ![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/3ddesdat.png) on the toolbar - see [Editing design data](../h8800.htm#0000) When importing a Tubesheet from DesignCalcs, the software will automatically create any adjacent flange, shell or channel components if they are missing from the model. Any flanges that are added will be the same thickness as the Tubesheet, any shells added will have the same length as their diameter. The user is advised to check all data after import has finished. Check all pressures, temperatures and corrosion allowances are set correctly. Click ![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/3ddesdat.png) on the toolbar, then double click on the first entry in the list - see [Design Condition Data](../h9103.htm#0000).
