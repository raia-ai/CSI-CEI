# Importing & Exporting to JSON

## Importing & Exporting to JSON

The software has the ability to import from a JSON file and export the currect model to a JSON file format.

### Exporting

From the **File** menu select **Export Item to JSON** or the ![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/ExpJson.png) from the tool bar, the explorer dialog will then be displayed. Navigate to the location for the destination JSON file, then click the **Save** button, the software will then proceed to export the file.

### Importing

From the **File** menu select **Import from JSON** or the ![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/ImpJson.png) from the tool bar, the explorer dialog will then be displayed. Navigate to the location of the JSON file, select the required file and click the **Open** button, the dialog shown below will then be displayed. ![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/impDCFile2.png) Navigate to the location for the destination Finglow file, then either select a file to overwrite, or click the **New item** check box and type a new description into the edit box. Then click the **Import** button, the software will then proceed to import the file.

### Messages

As the import progresses a series of warning messages will be displayed, depending on the components that are being imported. These messages will also be written to a file called **Import.txt** , which is located in the same directory as the destination Finglow file. This file will consist of some of the following messages. **NOTE: In general the component name in question will also be displayed at the beginning of these messages.**

### Additional Information

Finglow software has a very comprehensive inbuilt dimensional checking facility to make sure components fit together, so some components that are imported may not be valid in Finglow and will need further dimensional adjustment. These components will be greyed out and will display an error message in the tooltips when hovered over in the component tree control. These will have to be corrected before any calculations can be performed. When importing Tubesheet data, the **Conditions** data will not be transferred. This data can be input by clicking ![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/3ddesdat.png) on the toolbar - see [Editing design data](../h8800.htm#0000) When importing a Tubesheet from DesignCalcs, the software will automatically create any adjacent flange, shell or channel components if they are missing from the model. Any flanges that are added will be the same thickness as the Tubesheet, any shells added will have the same length as their diameter. The user is advised to check all data after import has finished. Check all pressures, temperatures and corrosion allowances are set correctly. Click ![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/3ddesdat.png) on the toolbar, then double click on the first entry in the list - see [Design Condition Data](../h9103.htm#0000).
