# EN 13445 - External Loads on Horizontal Vessels
* * *
# Program Capabilities
This program performs the calculations for the stresses in horizontal vessels subject to triaxial loading supported on two saddle supports located either symmetrically or asymmetrically in the longitudinal direction, in accordance with PD 5500 Annex G.3.3 with reference to BSI document PD 6497. Main areas of application are the analysis of vessels subject to wind shear, vessels sited in earthquake zones and also vessels intended for shipboard operations. The maximum allowable longitudinal compressive stress for the shell is calculated in accordance with 16.14.8. The program calculates the internal volume of the shell and heads in the uncorroded condition, and hence the weight of the liquid contents for a specified liquid level and specific gravity. The membrane stresses due to internal and external pressure are also calculated. The shell and head may be specified by either inside or outside diameter. All thicknesses are entered in the new or as built condition. Thinning allowances may be specified for the shell and the heads, either as a percentage of the new thickness or as an absolute value in mm or inches. The thinning allowance is always applied to the inside surface. Both internal and external corrosion allowances may be specified as required.
When _Accelerations_ are input the program will calculate the unit force\(s\) due to the mass being accelerated. The subsequent shear forces and bending moments are analysed in three directions.
For the Wind Loading case the longitudinal and transverse accelerations are calculated from the equation _a = Wind Shear / Total Mass_ , the wind shear is then distributed, as in the acceleration case, proportional to the mass. Vessels with unusual mass/wind distribution may require special attention. The vertical acceleration is taken as unity.
NOTE: The software uses the Zick method as referenced in PD 5500 Annex G as EN 13445 16.8.5 does not cater for lateral loading. However EN 13445 stress limits and other limitations have been used.

# Operation
## Conventions
A maximum of three shell sections, two cone sections and two optional heads may be specified. The validity of the vessel geometry is checked. Saddles and rings must be on one section of the shell or cone; they cannot straddle sections. A typical vessel configuration is detailed in the diagram below. 
![](..\\img\\sadact.png)
When entering location data, any datum can be used, however the vessel must be described from left to right as shown below. Typical input to describe the vessel above, with the datum at the head tangent line, would read as follows:- 
**Head data** |  |  |  | **Comment**  
---|---|---|---|---  
Head | - | No |  | No formed head present  
Location | mm | 9050 |  | Flange face  
**Shell data** |  |  |  |   
Location | mm | 9000 | 7000 | Left edge of shell  
Diameter | mm | 1000 | 2000 |   
**Conical shell data** |  |  |  |   
Location | mm | 8000 |  | Left edge of cone  
**Head data** |  |  |  |   
Head | - | Yes |  | Formed head present  
Location | mm | 0 |  | Tangent line  
Diameter | mm | 2000 |  |   
## Method
The vessel may be subject to triaxial accelerations X, Y and Z resulting in reactions _R_ x, _R_ y and _R_ z acting through the centre of the vessel at the saddle - see the diagram below.
Saddles are considered to be restrained such that translation is only possible at the sliding end in the X direction. Saddles may be asymmetrically located.
When calculating anchor bolt and base plate stresses the effect of the couple due to _F_ z and _R_ z is included with the reaction _R_ y. Reference is made to [Design of Welded Structures \[38\]](<h9998.htm>) page 3.3-9 for the interaction of bolt uplift load and concrete compression.

**Saddle Reactions**
NOTE: Forces and moments are positive in the direction shown, which is relative to the fixed saddle location- see the diagram below.
![](..\\img\\sadaxis.png)
**Saddle Axis**
Shear stresses are calculated by combining the reactions in the Y and Z directions vectorially.
Circumferential stresses on plain saddles are calculated by considering the vertical and lateral bending in the shell. Reference is made to [VBR 11 \[16\]](<h9998.htm>) Section 6.1 for the calculation of factor _K_ z = _K_ 6'. 
Circumferential stresses in saddles with rings are determined by the superposition of the bending stresses due to reactions _R_ z and _R_ y.
Bending stresses in ring type support are calculated using the vectorial addition of the reactions _R_ z and _R_ y.
Longitudinal stresses are calculated by considering the effective shell section at the saddles - see PD 6497 Figure 4 which shows the treatment of the effective shell. The diagram below shows the location of the stresses calculated.
Membrane stresses due to internal and/or external pressure are also included.
Where the shell remains circular, longitudinal stress is calculated by combining the moments in the vertical and lateral plane _M_ y and _M_ z vectorially. It should be noted that the location of the resultant stress is not necessarily on a vessel centre line.
The worst combination of tensile and/or compressive stresses are considered in the vicinity of the saddles as shown. The area shown in red is considered to be ineffective.
![](..\\img\\sadstr.png)
The resultant stresses at location A, B and C are as follows:
| Combined stress at A | = Stress 1 | \+ Stress 3 | \+ Stress 4  
---|---|---|---|---  
| Combined stress at B | = Stress 1 | \- Stress 3 | \+ Stress 4  
| Combined stress at C | = Stress 2 | \+ Stress 4 |   
where Stresses 1 to 4 are as defined in Longitudinal Stress Data and Longitudinal Stress Data.
NOTE: linear interpolation of stresses at the saddle and remote from the saddle occurs in the region D to E.
NOTE: the program does not calculate the discontinuity stresses at cone to cylinder junctions. These should be checked using [Shells - Internal Pressure](<h0201.htm>).
## Support Types
The following types of support are covered by the program: 
  * [Plain saddle](<h9988.htm#0010>).  
  * [Internal ring](<h9988.htm#0020>).  
  * [External ring](<h9988.htm#0020>).  
  * [Adjacent internal rings](<h9988.htm#0030>).  
  * [Adjacent external rings](<h9988.htm#0030>).  
  * [Ring support](<h9988.htm#0040>).
All support types may be welded to the shell or loose, except ring supports which are assumed to be welded. Saddle angles from 30° to 180° are permitted by the program, but it should be noted that 16.8.3 states that the included angle of a saddle support should normally be in the range 60° to 180°. Saddles outside this range would require careful consideration. This requirement is checked by the program. 
## Cylindrical Shell
The membrane stresses due to pressure are calculated using thin shell theory. If the ratio of shell outside diameter to inside diameter, _D_ o / _D_ i, exceeds 1.3 then the equations are not strictly valid and a warning message will be produced - see 3.2.2, NOTE 1. 
## Head Types
The program has the option to consider shells with formed heads as noted in [Saddle & Ring Supports - Dished Heads](<h0204.htm#0100>) or flat heads. The flat head option permits the user to model effects such as heat exchanger tubesheets. The only calculations affected by this selection are shear stresses in the head when the head is located close to the saddle.
## External Pressure
No special analysis of the shell is performed by this module for vessels subject to external pressure. The program will calculate the longitudinal compressive membrane stresses in the shell due to the external pressure. The shell must be separately checked for the external pressure condition using the [Shells - External Pressure](<h0202.htm>) module. It should be noted that deformation of the shell adjacent to the saddles due to the weight of the vessel and its contents may exceed the permissible out-of-roundness specified in the NOTE in PD 5500 3.6.2.1. Ring supports are preferable to saddle supports for vacuum vessels - see PD 5500 Annex G.3.3.1.
## Extended Wrapper Plates
If the calculated circumferential stresses in the shell are too high, then they can be reduced by fitting a wrapper plate or wear plate. The width of the wrapper plate should not be less than that specified in 16.8.4, and the wrapper plate must subtend an angle not less than that in 16.8.3. If the wrapper plate angle exceeds 180° then the calculations will be performed for a wrapper plate angle of 180°. It is recommended that the wrapper plate is made the same thickness as the shell - see 16.8.3\(b\).
If a wrapper plate is specified then the minimum required wrapper angle and width will be checked. If either the angle or the width is insufficient the wrapper will be ignored. If both the wrapper angle and width are sufficient then the relevant stresses are calculated in the wrapper at the edge of the saddle, using the combined shell and wrapper thickness, and also in the shell at the edge of the wrapper.
## Stiffening Rings
Additional stiffening of the shell may be provided by means of stiffening rings which may be positioned either externally or internally. The [Specification of Stiffening Rings](<h9990.htm>) is the same as that in _Shells - External Pressure_. The relevant corrosion allowance is deducted from all surfaces of stiffeners. NOTE: Wrapper plates, as detailed in Extended Wrapper Plates, are not considered to form part of any attached stiffening ring. When specifying internal or external rings adjacent to the saddles, it is assumed that there is a total of four rings, one either side of each saddle, and that all rings are of the same section. The information entered relates to one of the four identical rings. The distance between the stiffening rings adjacent to each saddle must be greater than the saddle width _b_ 1 plus 10 times the shell thickness _t_ , and less than the shell mean radius _r_.
## Ring Type Supports
[Ring support](<h9988.htm#0040>) are used where it is important to ensure that the shell close to the supports remains round. This applies particularly to thin walled vessels which may distort excessively due to the weight of the vessel and contents, and to vessels subject to vacuum.
## Factors
Factors _K_ 1 to _K_ 11 are calculated in accordance with the equations in BSI Document PD 6497.
When the saddle is welded to the shell the value of factor _K_ 5 is taken as one-tenth of the value from equation \(34\) in [\[15\]](<h9998.htm#0015>) \- see PD 5500 Annex G.3.3.2.6.2.
## Calculated and Allowable Stresses
Except as modified to suit asymmetric loading - see Method, stresses are calculated and checked generally in accordance with in [Saddle & Ring Supports](<h0204.htm>).
