# Flange to Shell Connections
There are four types of flange to shell connection covered by the program: 
  * Butt welded.  
  * Fillet welded: Stepped.  
  * Fillet welded: Smooth.  
  * Lap jointed.
## Butt welded
The flange is attached to the shell by a butt weld. This type of connection should also be specified when the flange is forged integrally with the shell with no flange to shell weld or when the flange is attached by full penetration welds \- see PD 5500 Annex E Figure E.32 or ASME VIII Div.1 Appendix 2 FIG. 2-4 \(5\), \(6\) & \(7\).

## Fillet welded: Stepped
The flange is attached to the shell by two fillet welds, one at the face of the flange and one at the back of the flange. The end of the shell is recessed below the face of the flange - see PD 5500 Annex E Figure E.33 or ASME VIII Div.1 Appendix 2 FIG. 2-4 \(3\), \(3a\), \(8\) and \(8a\).

## Fillet welded: Smooth
The flange is attached to the shell by a fillet weld at the back of the flange and a groove weld at the face or bore of the flange. The end of the shell is flush with the face of the flange - see PD 5500 Annex E Figure E.31 or ASME VIII Div.1 Appendix 2 FIG. 2-4 \(4\), \(4a\), and \(9\) to \(11\). For design purposes Fillet welded: Smooth flanges are considered equal to Fillet welded: Stepped.

## Lap jointed
The flange is not welded to the shell. The loose backing flange is located behind a lap or stub flange which is welded to the shell or formed integrally with the shell. The lap or stub flange may be specified with or without a hub. This connection type is not available for reverse flanges - see PD 5500 Annex E Figure E.35\(c\) and Suggested working forms \(4\) and \(5\) or ASME VIII Div.1 Appendix 2 FIG. 2-4\(1\) and \(2\).
