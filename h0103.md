* * *
# Program Capabilities
This program performs the calculations for the reinforcement requirements of single or combined nozzles or openings, either integrally reinforced or fitted with single-sided or double-sided reinforcing pads, in accordance with ASME VIII Div.1 clauses UG-36, UG-37, UG-40, UG-41, UG-42, UG-45 and Appendix 1-7. The minimum requirements for attachment welds are assessed in accordance with UW-16. Note that the geometric requirements of UW-16 and the exemptions given in UG-36\(c\)\(3\) are not checked by the program. In addition Fittings as per Figure UW-16.1 and UW-16.2 can be analyzed.
Joint efficiencies are evaluated by the program in accordance with UW-12 for the types of weld and level of radiography specified.
All shell and head types may be specified by either inside or outside diameter. Nozzles may be specified by nominal bore, inside diameter or outside diameter. All thicknesses are entered in the new or as built condition. Thinning allowance may be specified for the shell and the nozzles, either as a percentage of the new thickness or as an absolute value in mm or inches. Thinning allowances are always applied to the inside surface. Both internal and external corrosion allowances may be specified as required.

# Operation
## Weld Types and Radiography
### Shell Weld Type
The program will only permit valid weld types to be selected. If the shell or head is seamless, or if no part of the opening passes through a relevant weld then seamless should be selected.
For cylindrical and conical shells the weld considered is the longitudinal seam weld which is pierced by the nozzle or opening, and for dished heads it is the seam weld in the head pierced by the nozzle or opening. If the nozzle or opening pierces a circumferential weld or head to shell weld then this need not be considered - see definition of _E_ 1 in UG-37\(a\).
See also [Weld Types](<h0198.htm#0300>).
### Nozzle Weld Type
For all nozzle types, except Pad type connections, the longitudinal and circumferential seam welds in the nozzle neck must be specified. The program will only permit valid weld types to be selected. If there is no weld then seamless should be selected, as in the case of a forged nozzle or seamless pipe. The circumferential weld in the nozzle is not the nozzle to shell weld, but would typically be the nozzle neck to flange weld.
See also [Weld Types](<h0198.htm#0300>).
### Radiography
For each weld the level of radiography to be applied must be selected - see [Radiography](<h0198.htm#0500>).
### Diameter And Thickness Limits
The diameter and thickness limits are checked as detailed in [Diameter and Thickness Limits](<h0198.htm#0700>).
## Joint Efficiency
For longitudinal welds in shells or cones and seam welds in heads, which are pierced by the nozzle or opening, the joint efficiency _E_ 1 is determined from TABLE UW-12 for the specified joint type and radiography. When the joint is specified as seamless the joint efficiency is 1.0.
For longitudinal welds in nozzles the nozzle joint efficiency is determined from TABLE UW-12 for the specified joint type and radiography. For nozzles exceeding 10" nominal bore \(10.75" OD\) or with a wall thickness exceeding 1.125", if the longitudinal weld is set at Full, and the circumferential weld radiography is set at None, then the joint efficiency is reduced to the value from column \(b\) in TABLE UW-12 - see UW-12\(a\). This does not apply if the circumferential joint is seamless.
If the longitudinal joint is specified as seamless, the nozzle joint efficiency \(or more correctly, the quality factor\) is determined in accordance with UW-12\(d\). It should be noted that for nozzles exceeding 10" nominal bore \(10.75" OD\) or with a wall thickness exceeding 1.125", if no radiography is specified for the circumferential weld then the joint efficiency is reduced to 0.85. This does not apply if the circumferential joint is seamless.
NOTE: The nozzle joint efficiency is only used in the calculation of the minimum required nozzle thickness for internal pressure and used in the UG-45 check. For the calculation of the required nozzle thickness _t_ rn used in the reinforcement calculations the joint efficiency is always taken as 1.0.
See also [Joint Efficiency](<h0198.htm#0400>).
## Nozzles and Openings
### Nozzle Types
The basic types of nozzles and openings covered by the program are shown in [Nozzle Types](<h9993.htm#0500>).
The weld identification letters A to J are used in the definition of the strength paths for the weld strength calculations - see Weld Sizes and Weld Strengths.
### Nozzle Configuration & Location
The types of nozzle configurations covered by the program are shown in [Nozzle Configuration & Location](<h9993.htm#0100>) .
### Nozzle Dimensions
External and internal projections are measured along the centre-line of the nozzle from the nozzle reference point. For oblique or offset nozzles the program will check that the external projection on the shorter side is sufficient to clear the outside surface of the shell or pad.
For nozzles with single-sided or double-sided pads in cylindrical and conical shells, the pad outside diameter is measured in the longitudinal direction parallel to the surface of the vessel. For nozzles with pads in dished heads the pad diameter is measured parallel to the vessel wall at the midsurface of the pad thickness. The pad width from the outside surface of the nozzle to the outer edge of the pad is assumed to be constant. For Pad type openings the outside diameter of the pad is measured perpendicular to the centre-line of the opening.
The minimum thickness of the nozzle wall \(after deduction of thinning and corrosion allowances\) is checked against the requirements of UG-27\(c\) for cylindrical shells under internal pressure, and UG-45 and Code Interpretation:VIII-1-95-133 for minimum nozzle neck thickness. 
## Fittings
### Fitting Types
The basic types of fittings covered by the program are shown in [Fitting Types](<h9993.htm#0700>).
The weld identification letters A to J are used in the definition of the strength paths for the weld strength calculations - see Weld Sizes and Weld Strengths.
### Fitting Configuration & Location
The types of fitting configurations covered by the program are shown in [Nozzle Configuration & Location](<h9993.htm#0100>). Oblique or offset fittings are not catered for .
### Fitting Dimensions
External and internal projections are measured along the centre-line of the fitting from the fitting reference point.
The minimum thickness of the fitting wall \(after deduction of thinning, corrosion and threading allowances\) is checked against the requirements of UG-27\(c\) for cylindrical shells under internal pressure, and UG-45 and Code Interpretation:VIII-1-95-133 for minimum fitting neck thickness. 
At present, the fitting host is restricted to cylindrical shells and hemispherical heads.
### Fittings per Figure UW-16.1
Weld size checks are performed in accordance with UW-16\(f\)\(1\), or UW-16\(f\)\(2\) for welds that are exempt from size requirements. For fittings that comply with UW-16\(f\)\(2\) weld strength paths are checked, it addition this check can also be forced by the user.
### Fittings per Figure UW-16.2
Weld throat thickness and fitting wall thickness checks are performed in accordance with UW-16\(f\)\(3\). NOTE :- There is a max size limit of NPS 3 \(DN 80\).
For the fitting wall thickness checks the following options cases are checked.
If Code Case 3035 is not used the wall thickness is checked as per Table UW-16.1. See - [ minimum fitting wall thickness](<h9993.htm#0722>).
If Code Case 3035 is used and the fitting is socket welded the wall thickness is checked against the smaller of Table UW-16.1, the value from Code Case 3035 and the SWC thickness from the table shown in [ minimum fitting wall thickness](<h9993.htm#0722>).
If Code Case 3035 is used and the fitting is not socket welded the wall thickness is checked against the smaller of Table UW-16.1 and the value from Code Case 3035 the table shown in [ minimum fitting wall thickness](<h9993.htm#0722>).
A weld strength check is performed on the external fillet as per UG-18\(d\).
## Cylindrical Shells
When the design pressure _P_ does not exceed 0.385 _SE_ the required thickness _t_ r is calculated in accordance with UG-27\(c\). For higher pressures the thickness is determined in accordance with Appendix 1-2.
## Conical Shells
The inside diameter _D_ of the cone at the nozzle location is determined and the required thickness of the cone is calculated in accordance with UG-32\(f\).
## Ellipsoidal Heads
The required thickness _t_ r is calculated as defined in UG-37\(a\). Where the reinforcing extends beyond 80% of the shell diameter no checks are performed to ensure that the radial limits remain within the knuckle.
## Hemispherical Heads or Spherical Shells
When the design pressure _P_ does not exceed 0.665 _SE_ the required thickness _t_ r is calculated in accordance with UG-32\(e\). For higher pressures the thickness is determined in accordance with Appendix 1-3. For spherical shell calculations the hemispherical head option should be selected.
## Torispherical Heads
The required thickness _t_ r is calculated as defined in UG-37\(a\). Where the reinforcing extends beyond the spherical portion of the head no checks are performed to ensure that the radial limits remain within the knuckle.
## Nozzle Reinforcement
The requirements for reinforcement of single nozzles or openings in cylindrical or conical shells are calculated for two planes through the centre of the opening and normal to the surface of the vessel. The first plane \(Long axis\) is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the vessel and the second plane \(Tran axis\) is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis.
The requirements for reinforcement of single nozzles or openings in dished heads are calculated for one plane through the centre of the head and the centre of the nozzle.
The cross-section areas available for reinforcement in the shell, nozzle, pads and welds, and which are contained within the limits of reinforcement are calculated. For cylindrical and conical shells where the size of the opening exceeds the limit specified in UG-36\(b\)\(1\) the supplemental rules of Appendix 1-7 are also applied - see Appendix 1-7\(c\) for fabrication and inspection recommendations. Note that any nozzle flange material falling within the limits of Figures 1-7-1 or 1-7-2 is ignored. 
The limits of reinforcement are calculated in accordance with UG-40 and are measured as follows: 
  * _Reinf limit: radial_ \- measured parallel to the vessel wall from the centre of the nozzle or opening.  
  * _Reinf limit: normal_ \- measured parallel to the centre-line of the nozzle from the corroded outside surface of the vessel.  
  * _Reinf limit: normal \(int\)_ \- measured parallel to the centre-line of the nozzle from the corroded inside surface of the vessel.
If the supplemental rules of Appendix 1-7 apply then an additional limit of reinforcement is calculated: 
  * _Reinf limit: App 1-7\(a\)_ \- as defined in Appendix 1-7\(a\), measured parallel to the vessel wall from the centre of the nozzle or opening.
See [Limits of Reinforcement](<h9993.htm#0600>).
The limits of reinforcement in the nozzle are checked against the external and internal projections. If the limits of reinforcement extend beyond these physical limits then the area available will be limited to that within the physical limits.
When calculating the area available for reinforcement in the nozzle neck, the nominal nozzle wall thickness less corrosion is used with no deduction of thinning allowance \(mill tolerance\), as specified in the definition of _t_ n in UG-37\(a\). When an internal projection is specified the nominal nozzle wall thickness less twice the internal corrosion allowance is used when calculating the limit of reinforcement and the area available for reinforcement in the internal projection.
Different allowable stress values may be specified for the shell, nozzle and pads, and the program will calculate the appropriate values of strength reduction factors _f_ r1 to _f_ r4.
NOTE: FIG. UG-37.1 in the Code illustrates a typical nozzle configuration, and this figure and the equations beneath it are not necessarily correct for other nozzle types. For example, for a self-reinforced nozzle as shown in FIG. UG-40\(e-1\), the calculation of area _A_ 1 is incorrect. The portion of _A_ 1 which is within the nozzle wall should be calculated using _t_ x rather than _t_ n.
## Combined Reinforcement
The Combined reinforcement option may be used to enable the reinforcement requirements of any two nozzles or openings to be calculated. Operation is the same as for the case of a single nozzle with the exception that input data for two nozzles is requested and additional calculations are performed for the reinforcement requirements to UG-42\(a\) in the plane connecting the two openings.
The true pitch between the openings is calculated by the program at the midsurface of the corroded vessel wall, using the orientations and locations specified for each nozzle.
## Weld Sizes and Weld Strengths
The minimum requirements for attachment welds for nozzles and openings are checked in accordance with UW-16. The throat thickness of each weld, less the relevant corrosion allowance, is checked and a message produced if the weld size is too small. **NOTE:** With the exception of Fig UW-16.1\(p-1\) and \(p-2\) all welds for other _Pad type_ nozzles will be treated as per a _Plain_ nozzle.
Alternatively the user may select the _Size welds_ option. In this case the program will increase the input weld sizes as necessary to comply with UW-16. The required minimum weld leg lengths will be rounded up to the nearest 1mm or 1/16" depending on the units selected. A message will be displayed to indicate that the weld sizes input were insufficient. The required weld sizes will be automatically entered into the input data so that when the Calculate option is selected again the calculations will be repeated with the correct weld sizes and the message will not be displayed.
Strength calculations for attachment welds are performed in accordance with UW-15\(a\), \(b\) and \(c\), UG-41 and FIG. UG-41.1\(a\) and \(b\), modified as necessary for different types of nozzle. Weld strength calculations are not performed for the nozzle types specified in UW-15\(b\)
Each weld is identified by a letter and the welds in each failure path are defined using these letters, e.g. Strength path 1 \(A+B\). The weld identification letters are shown in [Nozzle Types](<h9993.htm#0500>).
## Test Conditions
Nozzles may be checked for the shop and/or site hydrostatic test conditions by setting the option _Check test case_ to _Yes_ \- see [Test Pressures](<h0198.htm#0200>).
If the design is not suitable for the test condition\(s\) appropriate warning messages will be produced. Detailed output data is not produced for the test conditions.

UG-16\(b\): Min thk | The shell, cone, head or fitting thickness less corrosion, thinning and threading allowances is less than 1/16" \(1.5mm\) - see UG-16\(b\). NOTE: the exceptions detailed in subparagraphs \(1\) to \(5\) are not checked.  
Unsuitable for external pressure | The calculated allowable external pressure for the shell, cone or head is less than the specified design external pressure.  
## Fatal Warning Messages
See [Fatal Messages](<h9997.htm#0502>).
Attachment | When analysing equal tees the _Attachment type_ must be _Set-on_.  
---|---  
Bad Xray/Weld selection | An invalid combination of weld type and radiography has been selected.  
Corroded failure | A component thickness is less than the corrosion allowance specified.  
Dia and/or thk invalid | A diameter and/or thickness is zero or the thickness exceeds the radius.  
DT stress > ATM stress | Material properties at the design temperature exceed those at room temperature.  
Input | An item of input data has not been entered.  
Inside head height | The inside head height is zero or greater than half the inside diameter.  
Inside knuckle radius | For a torispherical head the inside knuckle radius is zero or exceeds half the inside diameter  
Inside spherical radius | For a torispherical head the inside spherical radius is less than half the inside diameter.  
Insufficient thk | The thickness, less thinning and corrosion allowances, is insufficient for the design pressure.  
Invalid data | A combination of input data is invalid or inconsistent.  
Material | There has been an error getting data from the [Material Database](<h9996.htm>), a more detailed explanation of this error will displayed on the Material Dialog box of the specific material.  
Method failure | Component dimensions are such that the calculation method has failed - see also [Fatal Messages](<h9997.htm#0502>).  
Min nozzle thk for pressure | The thickness of the nozzle, less thinning and corrosion allowances, is insufficient for the design pressure.  
Oblique angle | An oblique angle greater than 80° has been input.  
Offset from centre | The centre of the nozzle or opening is in the knuckle region of a torispherical head or beyond the central 80% of an ellipsoidal head - see UG-37\(a\).  
Opening location | The bore of the nozzle or opening overlaps the end of the shell or cone, or extends into the knuckle region of a torispherical head or beyond the central 80% of an ellipsoidal head, or extends beyond the inside diameter of the shell or cone.  
Opening or Nozzle | The dimensions of the nozzle or opening are such that the nozzle OD and/or ID exceeds the shell OD and/or ID  
Orientation | An orientation greater than or equal to 360° has been input.  
Outside head height | The outside head height is zero or greater than half the outside diameter.  
Pad thk | The pad thickness is insufficient for the corrosion allowance specified; or the insert plate thickness is less than the shell thickness.  
Size welds | The _Size welds_ option has been set to _Yes_ and the corroded thickness of one or more of the fillet or groove welds is less than the minimum specified in UW-16. The input data will be automatically updated with suitable values.  
Thickness | A new or as built thickness is less than the sum of corrosion/tolerance allowances.  
Thinning /Tolerance | The thickness tolerance is greater than the new or as built thickness.  
Weld throat thk | The _Size welds_ option has been set to _No_ and the thickness of one of the fillet welds is insufficient for the corrosion allowance specified. NOTE: Groove welds are not checked for zero input or corroded thickness less than zero, but a warning message will be generated if the weld size is less than the minimum to UW-16.
