# Operation
Nozzles and Openings Nozzle Types The basic types of nozzles and openings covered by the program are shown in [Nozzle Types](<h9993.htm#0500>). The weld identification letters A to J are used in the definition of the strength paths for the weld strength calculations - see Weld Sizes and Weld Strengths. Nozzle Configuration & Location The types of nozzle configurations covered by the program are shown in [Nozzle Configuration & Location](<h9993.htm#0100>). NOTE: The limitation specified in Annex A, clause A.3.3, that the nozzle should not be less than _2.5√\(R.e\)_ from another stress concentrating feature is not checked by this program - see [Local Loads on Cylinders](<h0005.htm>). Nozzle Dimensions External and internal projections are measured along the centre-line of the nozzle from the nozzle reference point. For oblique or offset nozzles the program checks that the external projection on the shorter side is sufficient to clear the outside surface of the shell or pad. For nozzles with single-sided or double-sided pads in cylindrical and conical shells, the pad outside diameter is measured in the longitudinal direction parallel to the surface of the vessel. For nozzles with pads in dished heads the pad diameter is measured parallel to the vessel wall at the mid-surface of the pad thickness. The pad width from the outside surface of the nozzle to the outer edge of the pad is assumed to be constant. For Pad type openings the outside diameter of the pad is measured perpendicular to the centre-line of the opening. The minimum thickness of the nozzle wall is checked against the requirements of 3.5.4.7. Cylindrical Shells  When the design pressure _p_ does not exceed 0.26 _f_ the required thickness _e ps_ is calculated in accordance with 3.5.1.2\(a\) equation \(3.5.1-1\). NOTE: When _p_ exceeds 0.26 _f_ the required thickness will give a ratio _D o_/_D i_ greater than 1.3. The mean diameter rules are not necessarily applicable - see 3.2.2 NOTE 1. Conical Shells  The inside diameter of the cone at the nozzle location is determined and the required thickness _e_ ps of the cone is calculated in accordance with 3.5.3. Ellipsoidal Heads  The program covers nozzles which comply with the requirements shown in Figure 3.5-8. The nozzle and**** reinforcing**** pad must be located entirely within a circle, the centre of which coincides with the centre of the head and the diameter of which is equal to 80% of the shell mean diameter. For ellipsoidal heads the equivalent outside spherical diameter _D o_ is calculated by multiplying the outside**** diameter _D_**** of the straight flange portion of the head by the factor obtained from the Table 3.5-1. The required thickness _e ps_ is calculated in accordance with 3.5.1.2\(b\). Hemispherical Heads The required thickness _e ps_ is calculated in accordance with 3.5.1.2\(b\). For spherical shells the hemispherical head option may be used. Torispherical Heads The program covers nozzles which comply with the requirements shown in Figure 3.5-8. The nozzle and reinforcing pad must be located entirely within a circle, the centre of which coincides with the centre of the head and the diameter of which is equal to 80% of the shell mean diameter. For torispherical heads the inside spherical diameter _D i_ is equal to twice the inside spherical radius _R_. The required thickness _e ps_ is calculated in accordance with 3.5.1.2\(b\). Nozzle Reinforcement  The program performs the reinforcement calculations for single nozzles in accordance with either 3.5.4 or 3.5.4.9 _Alternative 'pressure area' design method_ , as specified by the user. The requirements for reinforcement of single nozzles or openings in cylindrical or conical shells are calculated for two planes through the centre of the opening and normal to the surface of the vessel. The first plane is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the vessel and the second plane is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis. The requirements for reinforcement of single nozzles or openings in dished heads are calculated for one plane through the centre of the head and the centre of the nozzle. The nozzle or opening diameter is checked against the limitations specified in 3.5.4.2\(a\)\(1\)\(i\) for spherical shells, 3.5.4.2\(b\)\(3\) and \(4\) for cylindrical shells, 3.5.4.2\(c\)\(1\)\(i\) for conical shells, and 3.5.4.2\(d\)\(1\)\(i\) for dished ends. For oblique or offset nozzles the angle between the axis of the nozzle and a line normal to the surface of the shell is checked against the limit of 50° in accordance with 3.5.4.2\(a\)\(2\), 3.5.4.2\(b\)\(2\), 3.5.4.2\(c\)\(2\) and 3.5.4.2\(d\)\(2\). For nozzles fitted with reinforcing pads or doubling plates the limitations given in 3.5.4.5.1 are checked and appropriate warning messages produced. If the thickness of the pad exceeds the limit specified in 3.5.4.5.1\(c\) then only the permissible thickness will be used. For pad type connections the limitations given in 3.5.4.5.1\(c\) and 3.5.4.5.1\(d\) are checked and appropriate warning messages produced. If the thickness of the pad exceeds the limit specified in 3.5.4.5.1\(c\) then only the permissible thickness will be used. NOTE: The minimum thickness requirements specified in 3.5.4.8\(b\) and \(c\) for studded connections \(pad type connections with tapped holes\) are not checked by the program. The ratio of the design strength for the nozzle _f b_ to the design strength of the shell _f s_ is checked against the limits specified in 3.5.4.3.7. Note that with set-in or set-through nozzle types, where the ratio _f b_/_f s_ is less than 1.0, increasing the nozzle thickness for small nozzles can be counter-productive. The actual thickness of the nozzle wall _e ab_ is taken as the minimum thickness after deduction of thinning and corrosion allowances. When an internal projection is specified the nominal nozzle wall thickness less the thinning allowance and twice the internal corrosion allowance is used when calculating the limit of reinforcement and the thickness available for reinforcement in the internal projection. REINFORCEMENT TO PD 5500 SECTION 3.5.4 For pad connections the required shell thickness _e rs_ is calculated in accordance with 3.5.4.3.2. For all other nozzle types the required shell thickness _e rs_ and required nozzle thickness _e rb_ are calculated in accordance with 3.5.4.3.3. The required nozzle thickness _e rb_ is limited to a maximum of \(2 - _d_ /_D_\)_e_ rs in accordance with 3.5.4.3.4\(d\). If necessary the required shell thickness _e rs_ is increased to satisfy this requirement. When the design strength for the nozzle _f b_ is less than the design strength for the shell _f s_, the required nozzle thickness _e rb_\(_f s_/_f b_\) is the thickness _e rb_ increased by the ratio _f s_/_f b_ \- see 3.5.4.3.7. Subject to the above limitations, the program will optimise the design to give the maximum acceptable value of required nozzle thickness _e_ rb consistent with the specified nozzle dimensions. In cases where the reinforcement limit _L_ b extends beyond the projection of the nozzle, the distribution of the reinforcement will be modified to concentrate the material close to the opening in accordance with 3.5.4.3.4\(a\) - see Figures 3.5-29 and 3.5-30. The areas of fillet welds will be included where relevant. For pad connections, butt welded insert nozzles and nozzles fitted with reinforcing pads, if the required shell thickness _e_ rs exceeds the actual corroded shell thickness _e_ as then the available area within the limits of reinforcement is checked in accordance with 3.5.4.3.4\(b\) - see Figures 3.5-29 and 3.5-30. The limits of reinforcement are calculated in accordance with 3.5.4.3.4 and are measured as shown in Figures 3.5-14 to 3.5-23 and 3.5-26 to 3.5-30 - see [Limits of Reinforcement](<h9993.htm#0600>). REINFORCEMENT TO PD 5500 SECTION 3.5.4.9 PRESSURE AREA METHOD The limits of reinforcement are calculated in accordance with 3.5.4.9 and are measured as shown in Figure 3.5-32 - see [Limits of Reinforcement](<h9993.htm#0600>).  The cross sectional area and pressure areas within the reinforcing limits in the shell, and in the nozzle, internal projection, pad and fillet welds where relevant, are calculated as shown in Figure 3.5-32 - see [Area Calculation](<h9993.htm#0400>). When the design strength for the nozzle _f_ b is less than the design strength for the shell _f_ s, the area available in the nozzle and the internal projection is reduced by the ratio _f_ b /  _f_ s. The openings are checked using the fundamental criteria in accordance with 3.5.4.9.3\(a\). Combined Reinforcement The Combined reinforcement option may be used to enable the reinforcement requirements of any two nozzles or openings to be calculated. Operation is the same as for the case of a single nozzle with the exception that input data for two nozzles is requested and additional calculations are performed for the combined reinforcement requirements in accordance with 3.5.4.4.1 in the plane connecting the two openings. The true pitch between the openings is calculated by the program at the mid-thickness of the corroded vessel wall, using the orientations and locations specified for each nozzle. Weld Sizes and Weld Strengths  When the _Size welds_ option is set to _Yes_ the minimum requirements for attachment welds for nozzles and openings are checked generally in accordance with ASME VIII Div.1, UW-16 ref. [\[2\]](<h9998.htm#0002>). The throat thickness of each weld, less the relevant corrosion allowance, is checked and a message produced if the weld size is too small. These checks are for guidance only and the user should refer to PD 5500 Annex E for recommendations for weld sizes to PD 5500. The required minimum weld leg lengths is rounded up to the nearest 1mm or 1/16" depending on the units selected. A message will be displayed to indicate that the weld sizes input were insufficient. The required weld sizes will be automatically entered into the input data so that when the _Calculate_ option is selected again the calculations will be repeated with the new weld sizes. Although there is no specific requirement in PD 5500 to check the strength of nozzle attachment welds, the program includes weld strength calculations generally in accordance with ASME VIII Div.1, modified as necessary for different types of nozzle. No output data is produced for these calculations, but if the strength of one or more of the welds is found to be unsatisfactory then a warning message will be produced. Test Conditions  Nozzles may be checked for the shop and/or site hydrostatic test conditions by setting the option _Check test case_ to _Yes_ \- see [Test Pressures](<h0098.htm#0200>). If the design is not suitable for the test condition\(s\) appropriate warning messages will be produced. Detailed output data is not produced for test condition calculations.
