# Specification of Stiffening Rings
A variety of typical stiffening rings may be specified by means of a description of the general geometry in terms of a flange, web and lower flange. The lower flange is the one welded to the shell. A maximum of three rectangular blocks can be defined. It is not necessary for the flange or lower flange to be present - for example, a simple ring stiffener would consist of just a web with no flange and no lower flange. If so, the flange and lower flange dimensions would be entered as zero. The program does not, at present, handle stiffeners of circular section such as limpet coils.
The relevant corrosion allowance is deducted from all surfaces of stiffeners.
The diagram below indicates how the dimensions of the stiffener are defined for input.

The diagram below shows a selection of typical stiffener sections. Other types may be defined in a similar manner.

It should be noted that, for stiffeners on cylindrical shells the position of the centre of the lower flange relative to the web does not affect the calculation of the moment of inertia, but for stiffeners on cones this is not the case. When calculating the moment of inertia of a stiffener on a cone the program will assume that the centre of the web coincides with the centre of the lower flange.
