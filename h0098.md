# Shells & Heads
The following shell and head types may be selected:
## Cylindrical Shells
If the ratio of shell outside diameter to inside diameter, _D_ o / _D_ i, exceeds 1.3 then the equations are not strictly valid and a warning message will be produced - see 3.2.2, NOTE 1.
## Conical Shells
Concentric conical shells with or without knuckles at the large and small ends may be specified. If the knuckle radius is zero then the program assumes that no knuckle is present.
Eccentric conical shells without knuckles at the large and small ends may be specified subject to the limitations given in 3.5.3.7.
The cone geometry may be defined by specifying either the cone half apex angle or alternatively the cone length. Whichever is specified the program will calculate the other dimension.

## Ellipsoidal Heads
Ellipsoidal heads may be selected as either a standard 2:1 ellipsoidal head where the height of the head \(measured from the tan-line\) is a quarter of the diameter of the head skirt, or a general ellipsoidal head where the head height is specified by the user. For a 2:1 head, if internal dimensions have been specified the inside head height is determined from the inside diameter, and for external dimensions the outside head height is determined from the outside diameter \(all in the uncorroded condition\).
## Hemispherical Heads
Hemispherical heads intended for connection to a cylindrical shell may be selected.
For spherical shells the hemispherical head option may be selected. Please note, however, that the calculated weight and volume will be for a hemispherical head.
## Torispherical Heads
Torispherical heads may be selected as either a standard DIN Korbbogen head, with a crown radius 80% of the head outside diameter and a knuckle radius approximately 15.4% of the outside diameter, or a general torispherical head where the crown and knuckle radii are specified by the user.

# Test Pressures
Test pressure conditions are checked per PD 5500 section 5.8.5.2 against 90%_R e_ for membrane stress based calculations; alternatively allowable loads are increased by 125%. It should be noted that the 90%Re limit may not be suitable for all materials or component types. In cases of doubt further checks may be required.
The option _Check test case \(Menu\)_ has been included to permit the software to perform a check that the test case, if higher than standard \(see note\), governs the design. In most modules no output is produced if this check is passed. Select _Yes_ to perform a test case assessment generally as above. _Shop test pressure_ must be input, _Site test pressure_ is optional.
For the shop test condition the thickness used is the new thickness less any thinning allowance. For the site test condition the corrosion allowances are also deducted. Except as noted, the static head effects \(if any\) of the test media should be included in the test pressure.
For complex components deflection/distortion, which is not checked, may be the limiting factor.
NOTE: The _PED test pressure_ option may be used to calculate the required Shop test pressure in accordance with the European Pressure Equipment Directive \(PED\) [\[37\]](<h9998.htm#0037>). The Shop test pressure calculated will be the higher of that required in Section 5.8.5.1 and that required by Section 5.8.5.1, Note 2
See [Basis For Determining Test Pressure](<h9997.htm#0350>)

# Construction Category
The program covers vessels in Construction category 1, 2 or 3. Temperature, thickness and material property limits are checked in accordance with Section 3.4 and Sections 3.4 of the various material supplements 
For category 1 or 2 vessels the allowable stresses are based on the nominal design strength for the material. For category 3 vessels the allowable stresses are evaluated by the program based on the minimum tensile strength specified or minimum yield strength, as applicable. 
* * *
Design Strengths The design strengths of the material at atmospheric and design temperature should be entered as given in PD 5500 Annex K, and various Enquiry Cases or determined in accordance with Section 2.3.3.
* * *
Yield strength and Minimum tensile strength The specified minimum yield strength _R e_ for the material at room temperature should be entered as given in PD 5500, Annex K, and various Enquiry Cases. The minimum tensile strength _R m_ for the material at room temperature, should be entered as given in PD 5500 Annex K, and various Enquiry Cases.
* * *
Gaskets & Facings Although no specific gasket facing types are defined in PD 5500, there are various facing types available in the program which correspond to those commonly used for bolted flanged connections \- see [Facing & Gasket Data](<h9985.htm>) for details.  The surface finish on the flange face does not affect the calculations. However, reference should be made to Table 3.8-3 which gives recommended surface finishes for use with various gasket materials.  The gaskets available in the program correspond to those shown in Table 3.8-4. A list of the available gasket types is given in [Gasket types](<h9985.htm#0300>). The appropriate values for the gasket factor _m_ , gasket seating stress _y_ and the minimum gasket width _N_ min for the selected gasket material are supplied automatically by the program. In addition, a _User defined_ option is available to enable the user to enter specific values of gasket factor _m_ and gasket seating stress _y_ for gasket materials not listed in Table 3.8-4.  The gasket width is checked against the recommended minimum from Table 3.8-4.  See also [Mating flanges and facings](<h9985.htm#0200>) and [Gaskets with Pass partition ribs](<h9985.htm#1000>).  NOTE: Not all combinations of gasket and facing type are permitted - see [Gasket types](<h9985.htm#0300>). The valid combinations are based on those permitted in ASME VIII Div.1, Appendix 2, TABLE 2-5.1 ref. [\[2\]](<h9998.htm#0002>). 
* * *
Bolting Bolt cross-section areas and recommended clearances are provided automatically by the program. Two bolt tables are currently available: 
  * ISO metric series bolting to BS 3643 Parts 1 and 2 - see [\[12\]](<h9998.htm#0012>). The available bolt sizes range from M3 to M150.   
  * Inch series bolting to BS 1580 Parts 1 and 2 \(in accord with the corresponding sections of ANSI B1.1\) - see [\[4\]](<h9998.htm#0004>) and [\[10\]](<h9998.htm#0010>). The available bolt sizes range from 1/4 inch to 4 inch. 
Bolt root areas are evaluated in accordance with 3.8.1.4\(a\) for metric bolting or 3.8.1.4\(b\) for inch series bolting. Data for the bolting is given in [Bolting Data](<h9984.htm>), together with an explanation of the methods used to calculate the root areas of the bolts.  NOTE: The program covers a more extensive range of bolt sizes than that shown in Table 3.8-2.  For the requirements of 3.8.1.4 NOTE 1, small bolts are defined as having a diameter 12mm or less.  Recommended minimum clearances are based on TEMA TABLE D-5 ref. [\[26\]](<h9998.htm#0026>). In addition to the standard bolt tables a _User defined_ option is available to enable the user to enter specific values for the following items of data when applicable: 
  * Diameter  
  * Bolt area  
  * Minimum bolt pitch  
  * Minimum edge clearance  
  * Minimum hub clearance  
  * Thread pitch  
  * Hole dia
