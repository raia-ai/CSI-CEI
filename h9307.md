# Editing User Defined Material Database
This function allows the user to add/edit user defined materials.
After selecting _Materials - User defined materials_ from the _Tools_ menu or selecting ![](..\\img\\udeficon.png) from the toolbar, the list of user defined materials will be displayed.

The first time the user selects this the software will create an empty **Material 1** record. This can be edited by double clicking or right clicking on the material in the list box and selecting **Edit data** from the pop-up menu below.

The material data can then be edited as shown in the screen below.
NOTE - At this point the software has no indication of the design code the model may be using so all relevant material information is requested, it is the users option as to which values need be input - see [User defined material data](<h9138.htm#0000>).

NOTE - The data input is for the specific component thickness at the design temperature, other materials may have to be added for different thickness and design temperature variations.
