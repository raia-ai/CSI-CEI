## Unit Conversion
To convert a _single_ item of input data, e.g. if the input units required are in _deg.C_ but only data in _deg.F_ is available, then enter the known value and press the **F2** key, the following will be shown. Click OK and the required value will be input.
![](..\\img\\unitConv.png)
To convert _all_ of the current data from one set of units to the other, either click on the ![](..\\img\\unit.png) button on the toolbar or select _Change units_ from the _Tools_ menu. The prompt _Change units and convert all data to N mm degress C_ or _lbf inch degree F_ will appear as applicable. Click OK and the input units and all the data will be coverted. 
NB: Minor rounding errors may be evident, the user should check converted data.
* * *
# Dimensions and Tolerances
Diameters may be specified as either _Internal_ or _External_ diameters. Except as noted, all input dimensions are in the uncorroded condition. i.e. thicknesses should be entered in the new or as built condition.
Thinning allowances may be specified as a _Percentage_ of the new thickness or as an _Absolute_ value in mm or inches. Thinning allowances are always applied to the inside surface.
Both internal and external corrosion allowances may be specified as required.
* * *
# Thickness definitions
The three major thickness definitions used throughout the application are as follows:-
_New thickness_ | The nominal, _New_ or as-built thickness. Includes all allowances for material specification under-tolerance, fabrication thinning allowance and corrosion allowance.  
---|---  
_Analysis thickness_ | The _New thickness_ less all allowances for material specification under-tolerance, fabrication thinning allowance and corrosion allowance. For the calculation to be compliant the thickness should exceed the _Minimum required thickness._  
_Required thickness_ | The minimum thickness required by the Code or Standard formulae. Excludes all tolerances and corrosion.   
* * *
# Internal Pressure
The internal pressure may be input as either _p = Design pressure_ or _p = Pressure + static head_. If the _Pressure + static head_ option is selected an equivalent _Design pressure_ will be calculated, this will be the pressure due to the _static head_ of liquid plus the _Pressure_ specified. 
Generally, for _component_ based calculations such as a formed head the pressure _p_ required is that at the lowest part of the head. For _vessel_ based calculations such as tall vertical vessels or saddle supported vessels the _p_ required is at the top of the vessel and the software will take account of static head - see the applicable module help. 
When determining test pressures, the test pressure will be based on the _Design pressure_ input or the _Pressure_ input only, the _static head_ is only considered if the liquid _Specific Gravity_ exceeds unity. 
* * *
# Input pressures
Calculation \(or design\) pressures whether internal or external are generally input as positive numbers. _Design pressure_ \(internal\) is the combination of the _Max pressure_ inside the component and the _Max vacuum_ outside of the component. _External design pressure_ \(compressive\) is the combination of the _Max vacuum_ inside the component and the _Max pressure_ outside of the component. For calculation modules that consider two spaces simultaneously, such as heat exchangers, the software will calculate the _design pressures_ from the _maximums_ input. 
* * *
# Input temperatures
The _Design temperature_ for components is generally the higher of the _Max temperature_ inside the component and the _Max temperature_ outside of the component. 
For calculation modules that consider two spaces simultaneously, such as fixed tubesheet heat exchanger shells, the software will calculate the _design temperaturea_ from the _maximums_ input. For heat exchanger tubesheets the design temperature is input seperately. 
* * *
# Basis For Determining Test Pressure
When the _Design pressure_ has been determined using the _Pressure + Static Head_ option, then the pressure used as the basis for determining the test pressure is calculated as follows:- If the specific gravity of the _Static Head_ liquid is equal to or less than water then only the _Pressure_ component is considered, otherwise an additional pressure due to liquid head being heavier than water is added. 
* * *
# Design optimisation
For some flange configurations a _Design optimisation_ facility exists. 
The _design optimisation_ facility is not available for _EN1591_ or _EN13445 Annex G_ calculations, or when checking the test case. 
If the design option is not available for the flange configuration and the design option is set to _Yes_ a _Fatal Warning Message - Check Optimise \(option\)_ will be generated and the offending option will be set to _No_. 
### Optimise bolting
If this option is selected the user must specify the minimum bolt diameter and minimum number of bolts required. 
The program will calculate the required number of bolts, in multiples of four, required to satisfy the necessary area and clearance requirements \- see [Bolting Data](<h9984.htm>) for information on bolting. 
NOTE: This option is not available for _Reverse_ or _Lap joint_ flanges or for flanges with _Full faced_ gaskets. 
### Optimise gasket location
If this option is selected the user must specify the gasket width to be used. For _tongue and groove_ facing types the facing width must be specified. For gaskets with guide rings the guide ring width must be specified. 
The program will locate the gasket to minimise bolt area and balance the moment in the flange for the operating and bolting up conditions. 
NOTE: This option is not available for _Reverse_ or _Lap joint_ flanges or for flanges with _Full faced_ gaskets. 
### Optimise hub diameter
If this option is selected the large end hub diameter is optimised to give a value of factor _f_ approximately equal to 1.0, subject to the recommended clearance for the bolting and the specified limitation on the hub slope. 
NOTE: This option is only available for _Normal_ , _Butt welded_ flanges with a tapered hub. 
### Optimise hub length
If this option is selected the hub length is optimised to give a value of factor _f_ approximately equal to 1.0, subject to the specified limitation on hub slope. If this hub length is less than 1.5 _g_ 0 in the uncorroded condition then the length is increased accordingly. 
NOTE: This option is only available for _Normal_ , _Butt welded_ flanges with a tapered hub. 
### Optimise thickness
If this option is selected the flange thickness is optimised to give acceptable stresses in the operating and bolting-up conditions. 
* * *
# Bolt tightening method
Dependent on the bolt tightening method selected, _controlled_ or _uncontrolled_ , the user may enter a bolt pre-load \(per bolt\), see EN 1591-1 Annex C, Table C.1 for typical definitions. 
For Taylor Forge type calculation methods, the module will calculate the required bolt areas and bolting up loads without any enhancement of allowable bolts stresses. If the bolt load due to the pre-load is higher, the excess load greater than that required by the pressure load, will be balanced by the gasket and the flange moments will be calculated accordingly. 
The actual stress in the bolt will be checked against that permitted by the Code, e.g. PD 5500 3.8.1.4 permits a 20% increase for _controlled_ bolt tensioning. If the stress is higher than the allowable, but less than _R e / 2_, an _Acceptable calculation_ message will be generated, however, this will need to be agreed between the manufacturer, operator and inspecting authority. 
**Tightening method** | **Measuring method** | **Factors affecting bolt load scatter**  
---|---|---  
Impact wrench | None | Friction, Stiffness, Calibration  
Wrench | Operator feel or uncontrolled | Friction, Stiffness, Qualification of operator  
Wrench or hydraulic tensioner | Measuring of bolt elongation | Stiffness, Bolt length, Calibration  
Wrench | Measuring of turn of nut, nearly to bolt yield | Stiffness, Friction, Calibration  
Wrench | Measuring of torque and turn of nut, nearly to bolt yield | Calibration  
Torque wrench | Measuring of torque only | Friction, Calibration, Lubrication  
Hydraulic tensioner | Measuring of hydraulic pressure | Stiffness, Bolt length, Calibration

# Loads across Tubesheets
For some flange pairs, typically a pair of flanges trapping a tubesheet, the total bolt load coming from the other flange \(high pressure side\) may govern the design. 
The _Loads across TS_ menu permits the incorporation of such loads. If the user sets this option to _Yes_ the following additional inputs will appear; _Applied load: bolting-up_ and _Applied load: operating_. Enter the total bolt loads as applicable. 
For flange modules if _No_ is selected, as would be the case when designing the high pressure side of a heat exchanger flange pair, the calculated values of _Applied load: bolting-up_ and _Applied load: operating_ to be considered for the low pressure side are automatically retained. 
* * *
# Pressure Load
Normally, tabulated nozzle loads or loads from a piping analysis **include** the pressure thrust on a nozzle, if this is the case, the option _Pressure Load_ should be set to _No_. If it is required to add the pressure load of a 'blanked' nozzle to the radial load input, as shown in the diagram below, set this option to _Yes_. 
![](..\\img\\pLoad.png)
* * *
# External Load Modules
External loads modules cater for general membrane stresses for the specified loading conditions. Detailed discontinuity stresses, such as cone/cylinder junctions, should be analysed using the appropriate modules. 
* * *
# System Messages
Messages are generated for each individual calculation and are categorised as either _Advisory_ or _Fatal_ \- see below. The messages relating to the different modules are described in the relevant sections.
## Warning and Advisory Messages
If the input data is acceptable and the program has completed the calculations, a message will be displayed in the Calculation Status message box.
The message _Acceptable calculation_ indicates that all the calculations and checks have been carried out successfully and no errors have been found.
The message _Warnings_ indicates that one or more warning messages has been generated. These warning messages will also be displayed in the Calculation Status message box. If the warning messages are only minor then _Acceptable calculation_ will also be displayed. The warning messages that are displayed on the screen will also be printed at the end of the calculation. The user is advised to consider the suitability of the calculation and comment the output accordingly.
## Fatal Warning Messages
When a serious error is detected by the program the calculation will be terminated. A _Fatal Warning_ message will be displayed in the Calculation Status message box, preceded by the word _Check_. When viewing the input data the incorrect or missing item\(s\) of input data will be displayed in red.
When viewing the output data it will be found that the output is incomplete. The program will not allow the output from such a calculation to be saved in a _Print File_ , but the _Quick Print_ option may be used.
Under exceptional circumstances the messages _Contact Finglow: Error \[xx yy\]_ or _Check - Report this to Finglow_ will occur. Users are requested to e-mail a _complete_ _Quick Print_ of the calculation that generated the message to Finglow for further analysis.
If the message _Check - Installation Error_ is encountered, contact your IT department.

# Basic Seismic Factor
The Basic Seismic Factor input is in effect the value V/W, where V is the total shear and W the weight of the vessel. However the factor depends on the building code and seismic zone specified for the design. For example, in the Uniform Building Code 1997 section 1630.2.1:
![](..\\img\\q0002.png)
and hence the Basic Factor is given by 
![](..\\img\\q0003.png)
Where **_C v_** is the seismic coefficient as specified in UBC Table 16-R
**_I_** is the importance factor specified in Table 16-K
**_R_** is the numerical coefficient representing the over-strength as specified in Table 16-N or 16-P
**_T_** is the fundamental period of vibration
* * *
# Metal Temperatures
If the mean metal temperatures are not known, they will be calculated by the program on the following basis:
Shellside = _T s_
Tubeside = ![](..\\img\\q0029.png)
where _T s_ = Average of Shellside inlet and outlet temperature
_T t_ = Average of Tubeside inlet and outlet temperature
_H s_ = Shellside heat transfer coefficient
_H t_ = Tubeside heat transfer coefficient
* * *
# Pipe and Shell Flexibility
When considering the loadings on nozzles due to attached piping it is possible for the program to calculate a reduced radial load and reduced longitudinal and circumferential moments using a linear interpolation of the shell and pipe spring characteristics. To use this facility, select Constant Loads = No and enter the free end rotations _R_ x,_R_ y and the free end deflection _D_ z.
The _Free end rotn_ _R_ x is the rotation of the attached piping or other loading system that would occur about the X axis if the nozzle or attachment were completely free to rotate about this axis. Similarly the _Free end rotn_ _R_ y is the rotation that would occur about the Y axis. The _Free end defl_ _D_ z is the deflection that would occur in the Z direction if the nozzle or attachment were completely free to move in this direction. The moments X and Y and the radial load Z must be entered as the moments and load that are applied assuming that the nozzle or attachment is a rigid anchor.
The signs of the free end deflection and rotations must be the same as those of the corresponding load and moments.
The diagram below shows a graphical representation of the application of the vessel and piping spring characteristics to obtain the actual equilibrium moments and load applied to the nozzle or attachment.

# Skirt Attachment
The _Fillet welded_ option should be set to **_Yes_** or **_No_** depending on the type of skirt to head attachment as shown in the diagram below.
