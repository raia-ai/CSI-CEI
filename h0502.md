# ASME VIII Div.2 - Shells - External Pressure
# Cylindrical or Conical Shells & Heads
* * *
# Program Capabilities
This program performs the calculations for cylindrical and conical shells and formed heads subject to external pressure in accordance with ASME VIII Div.2 paragraph 4.4. NOTE: All design stress are time-independent.
Weld joint efficiency is determined from Table 7.2
The calculations assume that the out of roundness of the shell or head complies with the requirements of paragraph 4.4.
All shell and head types may be specified by either inside or outside diameter. All thicknesses are entered in the new or as built condition. A thinning allowance may be specified for the shell, head or cone, either as a percentage of the new thickness or as an absolute value in mm or inches. The thinning allowance is always applied to the inside surface. Both internal and external corrosion allowances may be specified as required.
If the external design pressure exceeds the internal design pressure for the shell, head or cone then the user is advised check the thickness using the Shells - Internal Pressure module; with the design pressure set equal to the required external design pressure.
Cones may be specified with different thicknesses at the large and small ends. All material parameters determined using the thicker thickness. If a stiffening ring is specified for a cone, it is assumed that it is located on the thicker cone thickness.

# Operation
## Cylindrical Shells
For cylindrical shells with or without stiffening rings the program calculates the maximum allowable external working pressure _P_ a in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 4.5 for the effective shell length specified. The minimum required shell thickness for the equivalent internal or the specified external pressure is also calculated.
For unstiffened shells the effective shell length between End location 1 and End location 2 should be as defined in Figure 4.4.2.
NOTE: When the cylindrical shell is attached to a formed head, a length equal to 1/3 of the external head height, measured from the tangent line, must be included in the effective length at that end.
If the unstiffened shell thickness is not suitable for the required external pressure it may be necessary to provide one or more stiffening rings. The calculations for the stiffening rings are performed in accordance with paragraph 4.4.5.2.
Stiffening rings may be either internal or external, and most stiffener types which consist of a combination of rectangular sections may be defined. Only one stiffener may be checked in a single run of the program. Stiffeners are consider to be _Small Stiffening Rings_ per paragraph 4.4.5.2 b\) If all the stiffeners on the shell are identical, the data should be entered for the section of shell with the longest effective length. If the stiffeners are not identical it will be necessary to perform separate calculations for each stiffener size or bay length.
Stiffener positions are specified in terms of a Subject stiffener location \(the one to be analysed\) and the adjacent stiffeners on either side \(Stiffener or end location 1 and Stiffener or end location 2\) which, if not applicable in a particular case, can be the ends of the shell. NB: Locations are entered in ascending or descending order. The diagram below shows a typical example of a shell provided with two stiffening rings of identical section but unequally spaced along the shell.
![](..\\img\\stifloc3.png)
Assuming the 'datum' location is at 0, the following data would be entered:
End location 1 | inches | -10.0  
---|---|---  
Stiffener or end locn 1 | inches | -10.0  
Subject stiffener locn  | inches | 100.0  
Stiffener or end locn 2 | inches | 185.0  
End location 2 | inches | 250.0  
The datum point need not necessarily be positioned at a tangent line. On a vertical vessel, for example, the datum point could be at the underside of the base plate.
The required moment of inertia of the combined ring-shell cross section is checked against the available moment of inertia. The maximum allowable external working pressure is calculated for the longer of the shell sections either side of the subject stiffener \(in the example in above a shell length _L_ of 110 inches would be used\).
## Conical Shells
The program does not cater for cones with a half apex angle exceeding 60°. The Code recommends that such cones are designed in accordance with Part 5. The program does not cater for eccentric cones.
The program calculates the maximum allowable external working pressure _P_ a in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 4.4.6 for the effective length specified. The minimum required cone thickness for the equivalent internal or the specified external pressure is also calculated.
For unstiffened cones the axial length _L_ is as defined in Figure 4.4.6.
NOTE: If the cone is attached to a cylindrical shell at the large or small end, the cone may only be analysed separately if the cone to cylinder junctions are considered to act as lines of support satisfying the requirements of Figures 4.4.1 & 4.4.2. If the cone to cylinder junctions are not considered to act as lines of support the length of the cone should be included with the adjacent cylindrical shell
If the unstiffened cone thickness is not suitable for the required external pressure it may be necessary to provide one or more stiffening rings. The calculations for the stiffeners are performed in accordance with paragraph 4.4.6.2.
Stiffening rings may be either internal or external, and most stiffener types which consist of a combination of rectangular sections may be defined. Only one stiffener may be checked in a single run of the program. If more than one stiffener is required on the cone it will be necessary to perform separate calculations for each stiffener. See also [Conical Shells](<h9987.htm>)
The required moment of inertia of the combined ring-cone cross section is checked against the available moment of inertia. The maximum allowable external working pressure is calculated for both the small end \(Stiffener or end location 2 to Subject stiffener location\) and for the large end \(Subject stiffener location to Stiffener or end location 1\).
## Small End Reinforcement
Stresses are calculated for all combinations of pressure and moment in accordance with paragraph 4.3.11 for cones without a knuckle at the small end and paragraph 4.3.12 for cones with a knuckle at the small end. The method does not currently cater for reinforcing rings at the cone/cylinder junction.
## Large End Reinforcement
Stresses are calculated for all combinations of pressure and moment in accordance with paragraph 4.3.11 for cones without a knuckle at the large end and paragraph 4.3.12 for cones with a knuckle at the large end. The method does not currently cater for reinforcing rings at the cone/cylinder junction.
## Ellipsoidal Heads
The maximum allowable external working pressure is calculated in accordance with paragraph 4.4.9. The minimum required head thickness for the equivalent internal or the specified external pressure is also calculated.
## Hemispherical Heads
The maximum allowable external working pressure is calculated in accordance with paragraph 4.4.7. 
For spherical shell calculations the hemispherical head option may be selected. The minimum required head thickness for the equivalent internal or the specified external pressure is also calculated.
## Torispherical Heads
The maximum allowable external working pressure is calculated in accordance with paragraph 4.4.8. The minimum required head thickness for the equivalent internal or the specified external pressure is also calculated.
## Specification and Attachment of Stiffening Rings
A variety of typical stiffening rings may be specified - see [Specification of Stiffening Rings](<h9990.htm>). The weld attachment type is not considered.
