# ASME VIII Div.2 - Bolted or Welded Flat Heads

## ASME VIII Div.2 - Bolted or Welded Flat Heads

***

## Program Capabilities

This program performs calculations for unstayed circular flat heads and covers subject to internal pressure, in accordance with ASME VIII Div.2 paragraph 4.6. The joint efficiency _E_ is evaluated by the program in accordance Table 7.2 for the types of weld and level of radiography specified. The option to perform Rated Flange calculations is also available for B16.5 and B16.47 blind flanges. I addition the program can also perform MDMT calculations as per UCS-66. Flat heads or covers may be bolted, integrally forged, butt welded or fillet welded to the shell. The various types of flat head are specified from [Welded: Type 1](../h9991.htm#0001) to [Welded: Type 8](../h9991.htm#0008) and [Bolted: Type 1](../h9991.htm#0011) and [Bolted: Type 2](../h9991.htm#0012). NOTE: The program does not include bolted flat covers with metal-to-metal contact outside the bolt circle. Bolting data for standard metric and inch series bolts is provided by the program. Clearances are based on TEMA TABLE D-5 - see [\[26\]](../h9998.htm#0026). The deflection of bolted covers may also be checked, if necessary, in accordance with TEMA clause RCB-9.2.1. Dependent on the [Bolt tightening method](../h9997.htm#0400) selected, pre determined bolt loads can be applied. For bolted covers, the requirements of TEMA Section 5 RCB-11.7 [\[26\]](../h9998.htm#0026) for [pass partition plates](../h9985.htm#1000) can be considered, if required. All thicknesses are entered in the new or as built condition. Both internal and external corrosion allowances may be specified as required. The shell to which the flat head is fitted may be specified by either inside or outside diameter. A thinning allowance may be specified either as a percentage of the new thickness or as an absolute value in mm or inches. The thinning allowance is always applied to the inside surface.

## Operation

### Joint Efficiency

See also [Joint Efficiency](../h0598.htm#0400).

### Welded Flat Heads

Flat head types [Welded: Type 1](../h9991.htm#0001) to [Welded: Type 8](../h9991.htm#0008) are described in the following subsections. The corresponding identification letters from Table 4.6.1 are shown. The required thickness of welded flat heads is calculated in accordance with 4.6.2.2. The various limitations specified in 4.6.1 for each head type are checked by the program.

#### Intergral Or Butt Welded

[Welded: Type 2](../h9991.htm#0002), [Welded: Type 3](../h9991.htm#0003) and [Welded: Type 4](../h9991.htm#0004) are forged integral with the shell, or butt welded to the shell. These head types have an inside corner radius, and [Welded: Type 3](../h9991.htm#0003) and [Welded: Type 4](../h9991.htm#0004) have a straight flange section tapering down to the shell thickness. [Welded: Type 5](../h9991.htm#0005) construction is obtained by special techniques of upsetting and spinning the end of the shell, and is limited to shells with an inside diameter not exceeding 24 inches.

#### Fillet Welded To Inside Of Shell

[Welded: Type 1](../h9991.htm#0001) and [Welded: Type 6](../h9991.htm#0006) are fitted inside the shell and attached by two fillet welds. The fillet weld throat thicknesses are checked in the corroded condition.

#### Corner Joint

[Welded: Type 7](../h9991.htm#0007) and [Welded: Type 8](../h9991.htm#0008) are fitted to the end of the shell and attached by one of the weld types detailed in FIG. UW-13.2(a) to (g). For [Welded: Type 7](../h9991.htm#0007) heads the internal fillet weld throat thickness is checked in the corroded condition. NOTE: For these head types the weld dimensions, other than that indicated above, are not checked by the program.

### Bolted Flat Covers

Using the sketch identification letters from [Bolted: Type 1](../h9991.htm#0011) and [Bolted: Type 2](../h9991.htm#0012) the types of bolted flat heads included in the program are described in the following subsections. The corresponding identification letters from Table 4.6.1 are shown. NOTE: The bolted flat cover types 3 & 4 are not covered by ASME VIII Div.2.

#### Narrow Faced

The types shown in [Bolted: Type 1](../h9991.htm#0011) are bolted flat heads or covers with a gasket contact face that is entirely within the circle enclosed by the bolts. The required thickness of the bolted flat head is calculated in accordance with 4.6.2.3 for the operating and bolting-up conditions, and is checked against the corroded thickness of the flat head. If a pass partition groove depth is specified which exceeds the internal corrosion allowance, then the actual thickness is measured to the bottom of the groove. The minimum required edge thickness at, or outside the gasket location is calculated for the operating and bolting-up conditions using the formula in Table 4.6.1 detail 7.

#### Facing Types

The facing types available in the program for [Bolted: Type 1](../h9991.htm#0011) correspond to those shown in Table 4.16.3. In addition an _O-ring_ groove facing type is available for rubber O-ring joints - see [Facing & Gasket Data](../h9985.htm). [Bolted: Type 2](../h9991.htm#0012) is a bolted flat cover with a full-face gasket extending outside the bolt circle. The required thickness is calculated in accordance with Table 4.6.1 detail 8, and is checked against the corroded thickness of the flat head. NOTE: For facing _Tongue & Groove T.1c/d_ with a _Raised_ face, the facing height is also deducted from the specified new thickness of the cover. NOTE: For facings with a serrated finish, the serration size is not input and is therefore not checked by the program. The user must ensure that the correct facing type is selected. For a raised or flat face, a confined gasket may be specified if required - see [Facings with Internally Confined Gaskets](../h9985.htm#0250) ![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/flatcov2.png) The diagram below shows how the internal and external corrosion allowances are applied to bolted flat covers. ![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/flatcov1.png)

### Gaskets & Facings

See [Gaskets & Facings](../h0598.htm#0500).

### Bolting

See [Bolting](../h0598.htm#0600) and [Bolting Data](../h9984.htm).

### TEMA Requirements

If required, the deflection of bolted covers may be checked in accordance with TEMA clause RCB-9.2.1. This requirement is intended to limit the deflection of bolted flat channel covers on heat exchangers to prevent loss of sealing between the gasket and the pass partition plate. For a Bolted: Type 2 covers (with full-face gaskets) it is assumed that there is no edge bending due to the bolting so the second term inside the brackets in the equation for the deflection _Y_ is not considered. The calculated deflection is checked against the TEMA recommended limits of 0.03 inches for diameters up to 24 inches, or 0.125% of the diameter for larger sizes.

### Test Conditions

Flat heads and covers may be checked for the shop and/or site hydrostatic test conditions by setting the option _Check test case_ to _Yes_ - see [Test Pressures](../h0598.htm#0200). NOTE: The test pressure condition considers only the flat cover material. The bolting or shell may govern the test case and should be considered separately.
