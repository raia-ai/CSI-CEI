# PD 5500 - Local Loads on Formed Heads
* * *
# Program Capabilities
This program performs the calculations for the assessment of stresses due to local loading on formed heads in accordance with PD 5500 Annex G.
The nomenclature used in the program output is generally in accordance with Annex G, except that the subscript _y_ is used in place of _φ_.
The stresses in the shell at the edge of a solid attachment, reinforcing pad or insert plate are calculated to G.2.4. The stresses in the shell at the edge of a nozzle are calculated to G.2.5.
PD 5500 Annex G does not include calculations for the stresses in the nozzle.
For nozzles, the membrane pressure stress in the shell at the attachment is not considered in Annex G. The software will check the membrane stress due to loads combined with the plain pressure stress. The resultant membrane stress intensity is then checked against 1.2 _f._
The stress due to internal pressure at the edge of a solid attachment, reinforcing pad or insert plate is calculated using thin shell theory for a spherical shell. The stress due to internal pressure at the edge of a nozzle is calculated to G.2.5.2. Shear stresses are calculated to G.2.3.6.3 for a solid attachment, reinforcing pad or insert plate, and to G.2.5.5 for a nozzle. The summation of stresses is generally in accordance with G.2.3.6.1 for a solid attachment, reinforcing pad or insert plate, and in accordance with G.2.5.6 for a nozzle. Allowable stresses are determined to Annex A.
The deflections and rotations are evaluated in accordance with G.2.4.3 and G.2.4.4 or Enquiry Case 137 paragraph 2 for hollow attachments.
The head may be specified by either inside or outside diameter. Nozzles may be specified by nominal bore, inside diameter or outside diameter. All thicknesses are entered in the new or as built condition. Thinning allowance may be specified for the head and the nozzles, either as a percentage of the new thickness or as an absolute value in mm or inches. Thinning allowances are always applied to the inside surface. Both internal and external corrosion allowances may be specified as required.
The membrane stresses in the nozzle neck due the combined effect of pressure and external loads are checked by the program. The calculation method employed is described in PD 5500 Annex B. External moments and shear forces are combined vectorially as applicable. A warning message is displayed if the allowable design stress is exceeded.
NOTE: The Code methods assume that the location of the nozzle or attachment is in the dished portion of the head and that nozzles are radial.
NOTE: The calculation method does not consider the effects of shear or torsional loads at the vessel surface.

# Operation
## Attachment Types
The following types of attachment are covered by the program: 
  * _Nozzle_ \- The following types of nozzles and openings may be selected - see [Nozzle Types](<h9993.htm#0500>): 
_Plain nozzle_
_Nozzle + single pad_
_Nozzle + double pad_
_Self reinforced_
_Butt welded insert_
_Pad_
  * _Solid circular_ \- A circular attachment which does not penetrate the head. The attachment itself may be hollow, as in the case of a lifting trunnion, but the stresses are calculated as if the attachment was solid.  
  * _Rectangular_ \- A rectangular attachment. The attachment itself may be hollow, as in the case of a "box" type support bracket, but the stresses are calculated as if the attachment was solid.  
  * _Square_ \- A square attachment \(equal length and width\). The attachment may be hollow as for the rectangular attachment.
## Loadings and Sign Convention
The following loadings may be specified for any type of attachment: see [Loadings and Sign Convention Heads](<h9981.htm#0020>). 
  * Load X \(shear\) - A shear load acting in the direction of the X axis.  
  * Load Y \(shear\) - A shear load acting in the direction of the Y axis.  
  * Load Z \(radial\) - A radial load acting in the direction of the Z axis. This corresponds to the load -_W_ in G.2.4.3 and -_Q_ in G.2.5.3. The sign convention for the load _W_ or _Q_ in G.2 is opposite to that used for Load Z by this program.  
  * Moment X - A bending moment acting about the X axis.  
  * Moment Y - A bending moment acting about the Y axis.  
  * Moment Z - A torsional moment acting about the Z axis.
## Rotation of Axes
The program includes a facility for converting the loading data from any arbitrary set of axes to those defined in [Loadings and Sign Convention Heads](<h9981.htm#0020>). This type of rotation is typically required for offset radial nozzles.
This is achieved by rotation about each axis as required. The operation of this facility is explained in [Rotation of Axes Example](<h9981.htm#0030>).
## Head Types
See [Shells & Heads](<h0098.htm#0100>) for available head types. The calculation assumes the nozzle or attachment is located entirely within the spherical or crown portion of the head.
## Internal Pressure
For all types of nozzle and other attachments the stresses in the head due to internal pressure are calculated and added to the stresses in the head due to the local loads. When a reinforcing pad or insert plate is specified the pressure stresses at the edge of the nozzle or attachment are calculated using the head plus pad thickness or the insert plate thickness. Reinforcing plates used with solid attachments are not considered to carry any pressure stress.
The membrane stress due to internal pressure at the edge of a solid attachment, reinforcing pad or insert plate is calculated using thin shell theory for a spherical shell. For ellipsoidal heads the equivalent outside spherical diameter _D_ o is calculated by multiplying the outside diameter _D_ of the straight flange portion of the head by the factor obtained from Table 3.5-1. The stress intensity due to internal pressure at the edge of a nozzle is calculated to G.2.5.2.
## Calculation of Stresses
To avoid a conservative summation of stresses, the program takes advantage of the symmetry for circular attachments and rotates the X and Y moments to give a combined moment. The shear loads X and Y are rotated through the same angle. The quadrants thus calculated may not line up with the X and Y axes input. The summation tables are presented in terms of quadrants relative to the axis of the combined moment.
### Edge Of Nozzle
The stresses in the head at the edge of a nozzle are calculated to G.2.5.
For butt welded insert nozzles the head thickness _T'_ is taken as the corroded thickness of the insert plate. For nozzles with reinforcing pads the thickness _T'_ is taken as the combined head plus pad thickness, less corrosion and thinning allowance.
The specified thinning allowance is not applied to reinforcing pads and insert plates.
The value of the non dimensional parameter ρ is calculated to G.2.5.1.2. The stress concentration factors \(scf\) for internal pressure _P_ , radial load _Q_ , bending moment _M_ and shear load _S_ are evaluated from Figures G.2.5-1, G.2.5-3, G.2.5-5, and G.2.5-7 respectively for flush nozzles \(set-on or set-in\); or from Figures G.2.5-2, G.2.5-4, G.2.5-6 and G.2.5-8 respectively for protruding nozzles \(set-through\).
The maximum stresses due to internal pressure _P_ , radial load _Q_ , bending moment _M_ and shear load _S_ are calculated in accordance with G.2.5.2, G.2.5.3, G.2.5.4 and G.2.5.5 respectively.
If ρ is greater than 5.0 the values of scf at the limit value of ρ are used. If _t / T'_ is greater than 1.0 the values of scf at the limit value of _t_ / _T'_ are used. If the value of _R_ / _T'_ is less than 30.0 or greater than 150.0 the values of scf at the limit value of _R / T'_ are used. Appropriate warning messages will be produced if any of these parameters are out of range.
The data used by the program includes extrapolations of the curves in G.2.5. If any extrapolated values are used a warning message will be produced.
The shear stress due to the torsional moment _Z_ is calculated in accordance with G.2.3.6.3\(a\).
### Edge Of Solid Attachment
The stresses in the head at the edge of a solid attachment are calculated to G.2.4. For solid circular attachments the attachment and head are assumed to be symmetrical about the centre-line of the attachment, so the bending moments _X_ and _Y_ are combined into a single moment _M_ acting about an axis at an angle to the _X_ axis. The shear loads _X_ and _Y_ are resolved into loads acting along the axis of moment _M_ , and at right angles to the axis of moment _M_.
For attachments with insert plates the head thickness _t_ is taken as the corroded thickness of the insert plate. For attachments with reinforcing pads the thickness _t_ is taken as the combined head plus pad thickness, less corrosion and thinning allowance.
NOTE: The specified thinning allowance is not applied to reinforcing pads and insert plates.
The value of the factor _u_ is calculated to G.2.4.2. For the radial load the values of the stress resultants _M_ φ / _W_ , _M_ x / _W_ , _N_ φ _t_ /  _W_ and _N_ x _t_ / _W_ are evaluated from Figures G.2.4-4 to G.2.4-7. For the bending moment _M_ the values of the stress resultants \(_M_ φ /  _M_\)\(\), \(_M_ x / _M_ \)\(\) \(_N_ φ _t_ / _M_ \)\(\) and \(_N_ xt / _M_\)\(\) are evaluated from Figures G.2.4-10 to G.2.4-13.
If the value of _u_ is greater than 4.0, an appropriate warning message will be produced.
For attachments with reinforcing pads the calculation of the stresses in the shell and the pad at the edge of the attachment is performed in accordance with G.3.1.5. The stresses at the edge of the attachment are calculated by assuming that the moments _M_ φ and _M_ x are shared by the shell and the pad in proportion to the cubes of their thicknesses, and that the membrane forces _N_ φ and _N_ x are shared by the shell and the pad in proportion to their thicknesses - as recommended in G.3.1.5\(b\).
WARNING: For solid attachments on pads, the method assumes that the pad and shell form an integral whole, such that the moments are transmitted through the pad to the shell. This is not always the case in practice - see G.3.1.5.2.
Shear stresses are calculated in accordance with G.2.3.6.3.
### Edge Of Reinforcing Pad Or Insert Plate
The stresses in the head at the edge of a reinforcing pad or insert plate are calculated to G.2.4, as for the stresses at the edge of a solid attachment. The edge of an insert plate is taken as the large end of the taper, and the head thickness _t_ is taken as the head thickness less corrosion and thinning allowance.
## Stress Summation
The summation of the stresses at the edge of a nozzle is carried out in accordance with G.2.5.6, with the maximum stresses due to each of the individual loadings \(including pressure\) being added together.
For solid attachments and reinforcing pads or insert plates the loaded area is divided into quadrants labelled _Q 1_, _Q 2_, _Q 3_ and _Q 4_. The summation of the stresses at the edge of a solid attachment, due to the various loads and moments, is carried out at the inside and outside surface of the head or pad in each of the four quadrants in accordance with G.2.3.6.1 - see Figure G.2.3-4 and the suggested working form in Annex G.
When a pad or insert plate is fitted the summation of stresses is likewise carried out at the inside and outside surfaces of the head at the edge of the pad or insert plate.
Shear stresses are taken as positive - see G.2.3.6.1 NOTE 4.
The stresses due to internal pressure are included in the stress summation.
## Stress Intensities
For solid attachments and reinforcing pads or insert plates the total circumferential and meridional membrane stresses, _f_ φm and _f_ xm, are combined with the total shear stress t and the membrane stress intensity _f_ m is taken as the largest absolute value of stresses _f_ 1m, _f_ 2m and _f_ 3m which are calculated in accordance with Annex B.3.1.
Similarly, the total circumferential and meridional membrane plus bending stresses, _f_ φ and _f_ x, are combined with the total shear stress t and the total stress intensity _f_ max is taken as the largest absolute value of stresses _f_ 1, _f_ 2 and _f_ 3 which are calculated in accordance with Annex B.3.1:
At the edge of a nozzle, the method in G.2.5 does not give separate values for the membrane and bending components of the stress. The stresses calculated are the total membrane plus bending stresses.
## Compressive Stress
For solid attachments and reinforcing pads or insert plates the circumferential membrane and bending stresses due to the local loads are summed at each of the eight locations. The pressure stresses are not included in this summation. The meridional membrane and bending stresses due to the local loads are similarly summed. The maximum compressive stress is taken as the largest negative value of circumferential or meridional stress at any location where the corresponding membrane stress is compressive - see Annex A.3.3.3 and lines 30 and 32 of the suggested working form in Annex G.
At the edge of a nozzle, the method in G.2.5 does not give separate values for the membrane and bending components of the stress so it is not possible to determine the value of the maximum compressive stress.
NOTE: A conservative approximation for the maximum compressive stress at the edge of a nozzle may be obtained by subtracting the value of the Pressure stress _f_ p from the Memb + bending stress _f_ max in the subsection _Stress summary data_ section of the output.
## Allowable Stresses
The allowable values for shear stress, membrane stress intensity and total membrane plus bending stress intensity are determined by multiplying the design strength _f_ for the appropriate material by the factors which are specified in Annex A, as detailed below.
Shear stress - The allowable shear stress is 0.5 _f_ \- see A.3.3.3.
Membrane stress - The allowable membrane stress is 1.2 _f_ \- see A.3.3.1\(a\).
Membrane plus bending stress - For solid attachments and at the edge of reinforcing pads the allowable membrane plus bending stress is 2 _f_ \- see A.3.3.1\(b\). At the edge of a nozzle the allowable membrane plus bending stress is 2.25 _f_ \- see A.3.3.2.
Compressive stress - The allowable compressive stress is 90% of the minimum specified yield strength - see A.3.3.3.
## Deflection and Rotations
For nozzles and solid attachments the deflection _D_ z due to the radial load is calculated in accordance with G.2.4.3 using the factor from Figure G.2.4-3, and the rotations due to the moments are calculated in accordance with G.2.4.4 using the factor from Figure G.2.4-9. If the value of _u_ exceeds 4.0 a warning message is produced.
For hollow attachments calculations are performed per Enquiry Case 137.
For a nozzle or attachment with a reinforcing pad or insert plate, the deflections and rotations are calculated at the edge of the reinforcing pad or insert plate.
## Pipe and Shell Flexibility
When considering the loadings on nozzles due to attached piping it is possible for the program to calculate a reduced radial load and reduced moments using a linear interpolation of the shell and pipe spring characteristics. To use this facility data must be entered for the free end rotations _R_ x and _R_ y and the free end deflection _D_ z.
For details of this facility please refer to [Pipe and Shell Flexibility](<h9997.htm#0900>).
The signs of the free end deflection and rotations must be the same as those of the corresponding load and moments.
## General Limitations
G.2.4 contains one limitation for solid attachments and this is checked by the program. If the ratio _r_ o / _r_ is greater than 1/3 the method is not considered to be applicable.
G.2.5.1.1 contains one limitation for nozzles fitted with reinforcing pads or insert plates and this is checked by the program. The width of the pad or insert plate should not be less the distance _L s_ as defined in 3.5.4.3.4.
NOTE: This program does not repeat all the checks specified in 3.5.4. Users are assumed to have used the appropriate Nozzle Reinforcement modules in conjunction with this module.

Thickness limit exceeded | The material reference thickness exceeds the limit permitted for the construction category - see [Construction category](<h0098.htm#0600>)  
## Fatal Warning Messages
See [Fatal Messages](<h9997.htm#0502>).
Corroded failure | A component thickness is less than the corrosion allowance specified.  
---|---  
Dia and/or thk invalid | A diameter and/or thickness is zero or the thickness exceeds the radius.  
Free end defl Dz | The value of the free end deflection _D_ z has the opposite sign to that of the radial load _Z._  
Free end rotn Rx | The value of the free end rotation _R_ x has the opposite sign to that of the moment _X_.  
Free end rotn Ry | The value of the free end rotation _R_ y has the opposite sign to that of the moment _Y_.  
Group No. | The material group number is incompatible with the construction category - see [Construction category](<h0098.htm#0600>)  
Input | An item of input data has not been entered.  
Inside head height | The inside head height is zero or greater than half the inside diameter.  
Inside knuckle radius | For a torispherical head the inside knuckle radius is zero or exceeds half the inside diameter.  
Inside spherical radius | For a torispherical head the inside spherical radius is less than half the inside diameter.  
Invalid data | A combination of input data is invalid or inconsistent.  
Loads rotated | See Rotation of Axes.  
Material | There has been an error getting data from the [Material Database](<h9996.htm>), a more detailed explanation of this error will displayed on the Material Dialog box of the specific material.  
Method failure | Component dimensions are such that the calculation method has failed - see also [Fatal Messages](<h9997.htm#0502>).  
Outside head height | The outside head height is zero or greater than half the outside diameter.  
Pad thk | The pad thickness is insufficient for the corrosion allowance specified.  
Thickness | A new or as built thickness is less than the sum of corrosion/tolerance allowances.  
Tolerance | The thickness tolerance is greater than the new or as built thickness.
