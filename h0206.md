# EN 13445 - Local Loads on Formed Heads
* * *
# Program Capabilities
This program performs the calculations for the assessment of stresses due to local loading on formed heads in accordance with EN 13445-3 Section 16.4 for nozzles and Section 16.6 for solid attachments.
The deflections and rotations are evaluated in accordance with PD 5500 Annex G.2.2.4 and G.2.3.5 or PD 5500 Enquiry Case 137 for hollow attachments.
Nozzles may be specified by nominal bore, inside diameter or outside diameter. Thinning allowance may be specified for both the shell and the nozzles.
NOTE: The calculation method does not consider the effects of shear or torsional loads at the vessel surface.
* * *
# Operation
## Joint efficiency
For the purposes of assessing the local stresses due to loadings on nozzles and other attachments no account is taken of weld joint efficiency.
## Attachment Types
The following types of attachment are covered by the program: 
  * _Nozzle_ \- The following types of nozzles and openings may be selected - see [Nozzle Types](<h9993.htm#0500>): 
_Plain nozzle_
_Nozzle + single pad_
_Nozzle + double pad_
_Self reinforced_
_Butt welded insert_
_Pad_
  * _Solid circular_ \- A circular attachment which does not penetrate the head. The attachment itself may be hollow, as in the case of a lifting trunnion, but the stresses are calculated as if the attachment was solid.  
  * _Rectangular_ \- A rectangular attachment. The attachment itself may be hollow, as in the case of a "box" type support bracket, but the stresses are calculated as if the attachment was solid.  
  * _Square_ \- A square attachment \(equal length and width\). The attachment may be hollow as for the rectangular attachment.
## Loadings and Sign Convention
The following loadings may be specified for any type of attachment: see [Loadings and Sign Convention Shells](<h9981.htm#0010>). 
  * Load X \(long shear\) - This corresponds to the load _F_ L in Figure 16.5-1.  
  * Load Y \(circ shear\) - This corresponds to the load _F_ c in Figure 16.5-1.  
  * Load Z \(radial\) - This corresponds to the load _F_ R in Figure 16.5-1. The sign convention for the load _W_ in G.2.2 is opposite to that used for the radial load _F_ R \- hence _W_ = -_F_ R.  
  * Moment X \(circ\) - This corresponds to the moment _M_ c in Figure 16.5-1.  
  * Moment Y \(long\) - This corresponds to the moment _M_ L in Figure 16.5-1.  
  * Moment Z \(torsion\) - This corresponds to the moment _M_ T in Figure 16.5-1.
## Rotation of Axes
The program includes a facility for converting the loading data from any arbitrary set of axes to those defined in [Loadings and Sign Convention Shells](<h9981.htm#0010>). This type of rotation is typically required for offset radial nozzles.
This is achieved by rotation about each axis as required. The operation of this facility is explained in [Rotation of Axes Example](<h9981.htm#0030>).
## Deflection and Rotations
The calculation of deflection and rotation is not currently covered in EN 13445-3. The methods in PD 5500 Annex G are therefore used.
The deflections and rotations are evaluated in accordance with PD 5500 G.2.2.4 and G.2.3.5 or for hollow attachments per Enquiry Case 137, paragraph 3.
The deflection _D_ z due to the radial load _W_ is calculated in accordance with G.2.2.4 using the factor d _Er_ / _W_ from Figures G.2.2-18\(a\), G.2.2-18\(b\) or G.2.2-19.
The rotations due to the moments _M_ c and _M_ L are calculated in accordance with G.2.3.5 using the deflection d1 produced by the equivalent radial load _W_.
For a nozzle or attachment with a reinforcing pad or insert plate, the deflections and rotations are calculated at the edge of the reinforcing pad or insert plate. For nozzles without pads the rotation due to a circumferential moment is reduced by 25% as recommended in G.2.7 paragraph 4.
## Pipe and Shell Flexibility
When considering the loadings on nozzles due to attached piping it is possible for the program to calculate a reduced radial load and reduced moments using a linear interpolation of the shell and pipe spring characteristics. To use this facility data must be entered for the free end rotations _R_ x and _R_ y and the free end deflection _D_ z.
For details of this facility please refer to [Pipe and Shell Flexibility](<h9997.htm#0900>).
The signs of the free end deflection and rotations must be the same as those of the corresponding load and moments.
## General Limitations
The various limitations specified in PD 5500 Annex G are checked by the program. For further details please refer to [PD 5500 - Local Loads on Formed Heads](<h0006.htm>).
NOTE: This program does not repeat all the checks specified in Clause 9. Users are assumed to have used the appropriate Nozzles Reinforcement module in conjunction with this module.

# System Messages
## Warning and Advisory Messages
Messages printed below in _italics_ are not considered to be critical - see [Warnings Messages](<h9997.htm#0501>).
_Acceptable calculation_ | The calculations have been performed successfully and the calculated stresses are less than the corresponding allowable stresses.  
---|---  
Angle from normal | The angle between the axis of the nozzle and a line normal to the surface of the shell, cone or head, exceeds 50°. The program will show the effective increase in stress ratio caused by the nozzle being inclined from the normal - see [\[25\]](<h9998.htm#0025>).  
Code limitations exceeded | One or more of the following limitations has been exceeded. The appropriate values will be displayed in red. 
* 0.001 ≤ _e /R_ ≤ 0.1 
* _λ_ s ≤ 10.0. If this limit is exceeded the effect of a twisting moment should be considered. 
* Nozzle thickness maintained over a distance _√\(d.e_ b\). 
* 0.001 ≤ _e a/Deq_ ≤ 0.05 - see 16.7.3\(a\)

_Effective length: nozzle_ | For self reinforcing types the _Effective length: nozzle_ based on Code rules include nozzle thickness that is unable to contribute to the reinforcement. A lower limit generally per ASME VIII Div.1 FIG. UG-40 \(e-1\) has been used.  
_Effective length: shell_ | For butt welded types the pad thickness is not maintained over the permissible _Effective length: shell_. The _Effective length: shell_ is reduced to the available width as input.  
EN 13445-5 Table 6.6.1-1 | One or more of the parameters in the table _Testing groups for steel pressure vessels_ is outside the limits.

Min length | The minimum nozzle length requirement has not been met.  
Nozzle strength ratio | The nozzle strength check has failed, the ratio output should be ≤ 100%.
