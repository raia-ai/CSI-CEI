# How to calculate
## Calculation list
![](..\\img\\calclist.png)
The calculation data is arranged in a list with one Engineering Module under each button. This list is created automatically by the software, based on the components it finds in the Item model.
When the software adds a new calculation to the list its initial state will be disabled. To enable the calculation right click and select **Toggle calc status**.
Each list is made up of five columns:-
**Description** | A description of the calculation, initially this will be set by the software to the primary components name that generated this calculation.  
---|---  
**Last Calculated** | The date that this calculation was performed.  
**Status** | A symbol to represent the current status of the calculation  
![](..\\img\\calc_redo.png) | This calculation is pending.  
![](..\\img\\calc_bad.png) | An error has occurred which will not permit the program to run or which caused the program to abort before the calculation was complete.  
![](..\\img\\calc_ok.png) | Calculation performed succesfully.  
![](..\\img\\calc_ok_prn.png) | Calculation performed succesfully and the output data has been saved.  
![](..\\img\\calc_ok_rprn.png) | Calculation performed succesfully but the output data is out of date.  
![](..\\img\\calc_wrn.png) | Warning messages have occured during the calculation.  
**Condition** | A record number to represent the design condition\(s\) attached to this calculation.  
**Code** | The Design Code to which this calculation will be performed.  
By right clicking over a selected item in the list, the following menu will be displayed:-
**Calculate** | This option will perform the relevant calculation on the selected item\(s\), and will result in the Calculation option dialog being displayed.  
---|---  
**Toggle calc status** | This option will toggle the calculation in or out of the calculation sequence. If the item has been toggled off it will be greyed out.  
**Duplicate** | This option will duplicate the currently selected item.  
**Delete** | This option will delete the currently selected item.  
**Calculation options** | Select this option to set the Calculation Options.  
**Combine** | This option is only available when the user is on the **Nozzles** tab, and is used to combine nozzles see [How to combine nozzles](<h9300.htm>).  
Also by moving the cursor over a specific item in the list will cause the tooltips to pop-up, these are displayed in the following form
**Calculation:** | This is the calculation record number.  
---|---  
**Description** | This is the current description of the calculation.  
**Condition:** | This will display the title of the selected conditions for this calculation.  
**Status:** | This is the current calculation status of this item.  
## Calculate
After first checking the completeness of the design data entered, this option performs the relevant calculations from the entire list of design conditions displayed in the list. The Code design requirements and limitations are checked and a specific symbol relating to the outcome of the calculations and checks will be displayed in the **Status** column of the calculation list.
**NOTE:** The software does a preliminary check on the data before it performs the code calculations, this may result in a warning message as listed in Pre-calculation warnings.
The user can perform single or multiple calculations for one Engineering Module at a time by highlighting one or more items from the tabbed list then clicking the ![](..\\img\\3dcalcsel.png) button from the toolbar, or the user can double click on an single item. This will result in the Calculation option dialog being displayed.
The user can also perform calculations for the entire vessel using all the Engineering modules available by clicking the ![](..\\img\\calc.png) button from the toolbar. This will also result in the Calculation option dialog being displayed followed by the Calculation status dialog box.
## Item status
This dialog box can be used to show the status of the vessels entire set of calculations. Also buy pulling down the combo box the user can select a component from the list and display that components revision histoy.

## Calculation Page
This page will appear when the user clicks the ![](..\\img\\calcrev.png) button on the Calculation option dialog.
The software will have already performed the calculation and the input and output data will be displayed as shown below.
![](..\\img\\3dcalcpage.png)
Any data in the list that is displayed in blue may be modified, simply click on the data to edit the value. The data should then be re-calculated in order to transfer the revised calculation back to the Item model. This gives the user the ability to modify the design of a single component without affecting the rest of the model.
The button in the bottom left hand corner will display a system message along with the specific icon relating to the result of this particular calculation.
![](..\\img\\calc_ok.png)**Acceptable calculation** | All the calculations and checks have been carried out successfully and no errors have been found.  
---|---  
**Warning Messages** | The calculations have been completed but one or more warning messages will be generated by the program. By clicking this button the Warning Messages dialog is displayed. The item\(s\) of output data that contributed to these warnings will be circled in red - see [Warning and Advisory Messages.](<h9997.htm#0501>) for more details.  
**Fatal Warning Messages** | These are messages that indicate that an error has occurred which will not permit the program to run or which causes the program to abort before the calculations are complete. The error may be caused by missing data or by data which causes a calculation error such as division by zero. Fatal warning messages are preceded by the word _Check_ \- see [Fatal Warning Messages.](<h9997.htm#0502>)  
![](..\\img\\calcbtn.png) | Perform the relevant calculations based on the any new design data entered.  
---|---  
![](..\\img\\transfer.png) | This button will transfer any component data changed during the calculation to the Item model. NOTE: The data that is allowed to be changed will be displayed in blue - see [Data transfer ](<h9305.htm>)  
![](..\\img\\fileoutbtn.png) | Save the complete calculation for later printing in report format using the Format Design Report option. Finglow Software displays the Save Output dialog box to either overwrite an existing output file or create a new one.

## Pre-calculation warnings
Channel | When a Tubesheet calculation is being performed the software has found an incompatible channel component, the channel can only be made up of a cylindrical shell or a formed head.  
---|---  
Component quantity exceeded | The component quantity has exceeded the maximum the software can process, for example the Tower module can only process 10 cylindrical shells.  
Design data, space mis-match | When a Tubesheet calculation is being performed the software has found a design space mis-match. The channel must have a different design space than the shell - see [Design condition data](<h9103.htm#0000>).  
Dissimilar heads | When performing a simple saddle calculation ![](..\\img\\tab_mod04.png) the formed heads must be identical apart from the diameter.  
Dissimilar materials | When a Tubesheet has been defined with a increased thickness of shell adjacent to it, this must be of the same material as the connected cylindrical shell.  
Invalid gasket | An invalid gasket has been selected for the design code, edit the gasket in the component tree and select the correct gasket.  
Nozzle qty exceeded | At pressent the software cannot perform a combined nozzle calculation on flat heads.  
Pressure input | One of the design pressures has been input incorrectly.  
Proximity to Tubesheet - Fig 4.18.19 | The nozzle is outside the limits in 4.18.3\(h\).  
Saddles are not symmetrical | When performing a simple saddle calculation ![](..\\img\\tab_mod04.png) the saddles must be symmetrical.  
Too many shells | When a Tubesheet calculation is being performed the software has found too many sections of cylindrical shell.  
Too many additional loads | The software has found too many additional loads ![](..\\img\\3d_add.png), the maximum is 20. Try to combine any that are at the same location.  
Wind pressure data | The wind pressure data for _External loads on vertical vessels_ has not been entered - see ![](..\\img\\3ddefcalc.png) or click the ![](..\\img\\calcoptbtn.png) button for the individual calculation.
