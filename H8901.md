# Running a calculation
## Data Input
After selecting an Engineering Module from the menu the following screen type will be displayed.
![](..\\img\\screen.png)
The input screens are used to set various program options, such as the units of measurement, the shell type, etc., as well as the input of numeric and text data
The **Input** and **Output** pages are displayed on the left of the screen, to display another page select the required page from the list.
NOTE: Any pages that contain items of data that relate to the issued warnings will have a ![](..\\img\\calc_wrn.png) displayed next to them.
### Entering Input Data
Some basic checking of input data is performed as it is entered. For example, negative values will not be accepted when a positive value is required. No analysis of the data is performed at this stage - see [Calculate](<h8102.htm#0200>) option.
Priority is given to providing the most flexible means of entering and editing the data. When a particular line has the input focus the input Item description on the selected line will be highlighted blue. After entering data use the TAB or ENTER key to move to the next edit box or SHIFT TAB or SHIFT ENTER to move to the previous edit box or click the left mouse button on another edit box. As the edit box loses the input focus the basic data checking is performed, a warning message will appear if the data does not comply with the rules for that data input.
NOTE: The main system menus will be disabled during the entering of data into any edit box, they will only be enabled again when the data entering is complete and the particular edit box has lost the input focus.
### Edit Boxes
Edit boxes will accept data in two forms:
  * **Numeric Input:-** Numbers are entered as they would be into a standard pocket calculator. There is no need to enter unnecessary leading zeros in front of the decimal point or trailing zeros after the decimal point. For very large or very small numbers, exponential notation may be used. The following will all yield the same result: 0.003 .003 3e-3 3E-3. Any non-numeric characters other than e, E, a minus sign or a decimal point will be ignored.
  * **Text Input:-** Text input may consist of letters, numbers and other characters. Text input may be edited in the same way as numeric input.
### Drop-Down Lists
Drop-Down list inputs are used to select options. Pressing the button on the right hand side of the drop-down list will drop-down a list of available choices for that particular line on input. Typical multiple choice inputs are calculation type, level of radiography or weld type number, for each of which there is only a limited range of possible alternatives. Certain menu selections may restrict the available options on subsequent drop-down lists. Hence drop-down lists and input screens may increase or decrease in length depending on the selections made from other drop-down lists. In general, only valid options will appear on each drop-down list.
### Material Database Buttons
Access to the [Finglow Material Database](<h9996.htm>) is gained by pressing the Material Database button.
### Multiple-Column Input
Some data may need to be input using a number of columns, for example the External Loads on Vertical Vessels module has several pages of multiple column input. These input data pages will be displayed as shown below with the six navigation buttons on the toolbar becoming active.

NOTE: To move directly to any column on the screen, click on any edit box in that column. A maximum of five columns of data will be displayed on the screen at any one time, if there are more than five columns of data then the column number will be displayed above each of them.
