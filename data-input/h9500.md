The User ID may be two or three characters, the password must be four characters. Please consult the System Administrator for an individual ID and initial password. The password is not displayed on the screen when it is typed in. If an invalid ID or password is entered, the software will display a message _Invalid entry_. Pressing the Cancel button or three invalid attempts will abort the log on procedure.
