## Data Sheet Structure

The Data Sheet is split into three files - Screen Files, Equation Files and Function Files. The EFP Editor allows the creation and editing of these three file formats. Screen Files contain the screen layout for the data sheet, which can consist of free format text, input fields for entering data and output fields for the results of calculations. A screen file may contain up to 60 lines and each line may be up to 77 characters in length. Equation Files contain lists of equations corresponding to particular screen files. There is no limit on the length of each equation or the length of the equation file. Although there is a limit of 200 equations. Function Files contain lists of functions corresponding to particular equation files. A function file has the same format as an equation file. The initial screen will appear as shown: ![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/efpedit1.png)

### Data Sheet Structure

Before creating a new Data Sheet on the screen, it is recommended that a draft layout be prepared on paper. If the Data Sheet is being copied from an existing printed sheet then some modification of the layout may be necessary to fit within the program limitations of 50 lines and 77 columns. It will also be necessary to analyse the logic of the required calculation procedure so that it may be broken down into a sequence of program instructions. To copy and paste text in, and between Screen, Equation and function the following commands can be used. _Control+C_ to copy text to the clipboard, _Control+X_ to cut text to the clipboard and _Control+V_ to copy text from the clipboard. A [Worked Example](../h9705.htm#0100) is provided to demonstrate the use of the EFP editor. Screen FilesThe creation of a new Screen File or the editing of an existing Screen File is achieved by typing in text and using the standard cursor control keys to position the text, and the right button on the mouse to create fields refer to Creating Fields for further information. Any printable character may be used. In general it will be found to be easier to enter the text first, before creating the fields. To create a new Screen File, select the _Screen Files_ tab, then if the screen is empty just start typing, or if the screen already has some text in it just delete this first. To edit an existing Screen File, select the _Screen Files_ tab, then select the _Read Input_ option from the _File_ menu. Select the required file from the list of files displayed. The first 36 lines of the Screen File will be displayed on the screen. If the file is longer than this a scroll bar will appear. Creating Fields To create a field, first highlight the range of spaces over which to create the field, to do this hold down the left mouse button and drag the cursor to the desired position, then press the right mouse button and the menu will pop-up as shown below: ![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/efpedit2.png) After selecting the required field type, the following symbol will be displayed across the selected area # (Purple) for Alpha Fields # (Red) for Input Fields # (Blue) for Output Fields When creating Output fields it is important that the width of the field is sufficient to contain the largest anticipated value. When the _Calculate_ option is selected, if the width of the field is insufficient for the size of the calculated value, then the field will be filled with hash symbols (#). There is a limit of **240** fields per Screen File. Attempting to save the file when this limit is exceeded will generate the message _Field limit exceeded_. Creating Table When data is to be processed as a table, the line in the Screen File which contains the relevant fields should have the line attribute set as a table. To do this, highlight any character on the desired line and then press the right mouse button and, from the pop-up menu, select _Enable Table Line_ , this will underline the highlighted text i.e. (_Sample Text_), to indicate that this is a table line. To turn a table line back to a normal line select _Disable Table Line_ from the pop-up menu. There is a limit of 10 Tables per screen file. If more than 10 lines have been allocated as tables, attempting to save the file will generate the message _Table limit exceeded_. For identical contiguous table lines, all but one of those lines will be deleted when the file is saved. To save the completed Screen File. select the [Save Input](../h9801.htm#0200) option from the File menu. Equation Files To create a new Equation File, select the _Equation_ _Files_ tab, then if the screen is empty just start typing, or if the screen already has some text in it just delete this first. To edit an existing Equation File, select the _Equation_ _Files_ tab, then select the _Read Input_ option from the _File_ menu. Select the required file from the list of files displayed. The first 36 lines of the Equation File will be displayed on the screen. If the file is longer than this a scroll bar will appear. This screen is used for entering the equations which will be the program instructions for performing the calculations. It is recommended that, before entering the equations, the layout of the Data Sheet be finalised. NOTE : the positions of the Input and Output fields in the Screen file determine the Field Variable numbers referenced in the equations. Equations Equations should be typed in paying particular attention to the use of the correct syntax and the matching of parentheses (brackets). When entering characters the use of both upper and lower case is permitted. For Details of the equation format see [Equation Syntax](../h9702.htm#0101). Having completed the Equation File select the [Save Input](../h9801.htm#0200) option from the File menu. Function Files A range of useful functions is incorporated into the EFP module. However, the user may also define other functions for use in specific Calculation Sheets and these should be entered in Function Files. Functions are entered and edited in the same way as Equations. The maximum number of functions is 19. Details of the function format are given in [Function Syntax](../h9702.htm#0102).
