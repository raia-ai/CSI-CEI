# Nozzles & Openings
## Nozzle Configuration
For cylindrical or conical shells, nozzles other than _Pad_ type openings may be specified as _Radial_ , _Oblique_ or _Offset_ \- see diagram below. The _Orientation_ of an _Offset_ nozzle is to the line from which the _Offset from centre_ is dimensioned, for other nozzle types the _Orientation_ is measured to where the nozzle centre line bisects the shell outside surface. The centre-line of a _Radial_ nozzle is normal to the surface of the shell in both the longitudinal and circumferential planes. For an _Oblique_ nozzle the _Oblique_ angle is the angle in the longitudinal plane between the centre-line of the nozzle and a line normal to the surface of the shell, positive when sloping upward or in the direction of decreasing location. For an _Offset_ nozzle the _Offset from centre_ is the distance in the circumferential plane from the centre-line of the nozzle to the centre-line of the shell, measured perpendicular to the centre-line of the nozzle, positive when the actual nozzle orientation is less than the orientation from which it is measured.

NOTE: Nozzles may be oblique or offset, but not both.
For dished heads, nozzles other than _Pad_ type openings may be specified as _Radial_ or _Parallel_ \- see diagram below. The centre-line of a _Radial_ nozzle is normal to the surface of the head. For a _Parallel_ nozzle the _Offset from centre_ is the distance from the centre-line of the head to the centre-line of the nozzle, measured perpendicular to the centre-line of the head. The centre-line of an _Parallel_ nozzle is parallel to the centre-line of the head.

## Nozzle Location
For cylindrical and conical shells the location of each nozzle or opening is specified in terms of an _Orientation_ and an _Opening location_ \- see diagram above. The _Orientation_ is the angle in the circumferential plane between the datum or zero orientation and the nozzle reference point. The _Opening location_ is the location of the nozzle, measured along the axis of the shell or cone from the datum point to the nozzle reference point.
For dished heads the location of each nozzle or opening is specified in terms of an _Orientation_ and an _Offset from centre_ \- see diagram below.

The _Orientation_ is the angle in the plane perpendicular to the axis of the head between the datum or zero orientation and the nozzle reference point. The _Offset from centre_ is the distance from the centre-line of the head to the nozzle reference point, measured perpendicular to the centre-line of the head.
## Reference Point
The nozzle configuration, location and dimensions are specified relative to a reference point. This is defined as the point where the centre-line of the nozzle intersects the outside surface of the shell, cone, head or flat cover.

## Area Calculation
The software calculates the material and pressure areas for a _Set-In Pad_ type connection as shown below.

Limits of Reinforcement The limit of reinforcement in a shell or cone is checked against the following physical limits: 
  * The ends of a cylindrical shell or a conical shell without knuckles.  
  * The ends of the conical section of a cone with knuckles.  
The _Relax reinforcement limits_ menu permits the user to override these physical limits, for example in the case of a cylindrical shell welded to a cylindrical shell of greater thickness. If the limit of reinforcement extends beyond these limits and: 
  * the _Relax reinforcement limits_ menu is set to _No_ then the area available will be limited to that within the physical limits and a warning message stating _Reinforcement reduced by location_ will be produced.   
  * the _Relax reinforcement limits_ menu is set to _Yes_ then the area available will **_not_** be limited to that within the physical limits and a warning message stating _Location may reduce reinforcement_ will be produced. 
The limits of reinforcement in the nozzle are checked against the external and internal projections. If the limit of reinforcement extends beyond these projections then the area available is limited to that within the physical limits.
