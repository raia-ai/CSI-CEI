# Allowable Stresses
Maximum allowable stress of the material should be entered as given in ASME II, Part D, Subpart 1, Table 2A or 2B for construction class 1 or Table 5A or 5B for construction class 2.
* * *
# Test Pressures
Test pressure conditions are checked against 95%_S y_ in accordance with 4.1.6.2 \(a\) for membrane stress based calculations or 4.1.6.2 \(b\) for membrane + bending. 
The option _Check test case \(Menu\)_ has been included to permit the software to perform a check that the test case, if higher than standard, governs the design. In most modules no output is produced if this check is passed. Select _Yes_ to perform a test case assessment generally as above. _Shop test pressure_ must be input, _Site test pressure_ is optional.
For the shop test condition the thickness used is the new thickness less any thinning allowance. For the site test condition the corrosion allowances are also deducted. Except as noted, the static head effects \(if any\) of the test media should be included in the test pressure.
For complex components deflection/distortion, which is not checked, may be the limiting factor.
See [Basis For Determining Test Pressure](<h9997.htm#0350>)

# Examination Groups
All components are categorised by Examination Group as defined in Table 7.1. The Group restricts the permitted materials used, the thickness and the design basis.
**Examination Group** | **Permitted materials** | **Maximum thickness** | **Design Basis**  
---|---|---|---  
1a | All materials in Annex 3-A | Unlimited | Part 4 or 5  
1b | P-No. 1 Gr 1 and 2; P-No. 8 Gr 1. | Unlimited | Part 4 or 5  
2a | P-No. 8 and 11A Gr 2; P-No. 9A, 9B, 11A and 10H Gr 1. | 30mm for P-No. 9A and 9B; 16mm for the remaining. | Part 4 or 5  
2b | P-No. 1 Gr 1 and 2; P-No. 8 Gr 1. | 50mm for Gr 1; 30mm for Gr 2. | Part 4 or 5  
3a | P-No. 8 Gr 1; P-No. 91.& 10H Gr 1. | 30mm for P-No. 9A and 9B; 16mm for the remaining | Part 4

# Joint Efficiency
For all shell and head types the joint efficiency is obtained from Table 7.2 based on the Examination Group as defined in Table 7.1.
* * *
# Gaskets & Facings
The facing types available in the program correspond to those shown in Table 4.16.3. In addition, an O-ring groove facing type is available for rubber O-ring joints. See [Facing & Gasket Data](<h9985.htm>). 
NOTE: For facings with a serrated finish, the serration size is not input and is not therefore cannot be checked by the program. The user must ensure that the correct facing type is selected. 
The gaskets available in the program correspond to those shown in Table 4.16.1. A list of the available gasket types is given in [Gasket types](<h9985.htm#0300>). The appropriate values for the gasket factor _m_ and gasket seating stress _y_ for the selected gasket material are supplied automatically by the program. In addition, a _User defined_ option is available to enable the user to enter specific values of gasket factor _m_ and gasket seating stress _y_ for gasket materials not listed in Table 4.16.1. 
NOTE: Not all combinations of gasket and facing types are permitted - see [Gasket types](<h9985.htm#0300>) and Table 4.16.1 right hand column. 
The gasket width is checked against the recommended minimum from Table 4.16.2. 
See also [Mating flanges and facings](<h9985.htm#0200>) and [Gaskets with Pass partition ribs](<h9985.htm#1000>).

# Bolting
Bolt cross-section areas and recommended clearances are provided automatically by the program. Two bolt tables are currently available: 
  * ISO metric series bolting to BS 3643 Parts 1 and 2 - see [\[12\]](<h9998.htm#0012>). The available bolt sizes range from M3 to M150.  
  * Inch series bolting to BS 1580 Parts 1 and 2 \(in accord with the corresponding sections of ANSI B1.1\) - see [\[4\]](<h9998.htm#0004>) and [\[10\]](<h9998.htm#0010>). The available bolt sizes range from 1/4 inch to 4 inch.
Data for the bolting is given in [Bolting Data](<h9984.htm>), together with an explanation of the methods used to calculate the root areas of the bolts.
Recommended minimum clearances are based on TEMA TABLE D-5 - see [\[26\]](<h9998.htm#0026>).
In addition to the standard bolt tables a _User defined_ option is available to enable the user to enter specific values for the following items of data: 
  * Diameter  
  * Bolt area  
  * Minimum bolt pitch  
  * Minimum edge clearance
* * *
# Yield strength and Minimum tensile strength
The specified minimum yield strength for the material should be entered as given in ASME II, Part D, Subpart 1, Table 2A,2B,5A or 5B\(at room temperature\) or Table Y-1\(at elevated temperature\).
NOTE: When using the Material Database, the software will use the rules in Annex 3-D to calculate the yield strength if the material is not listed in Table Y-1.
The minimum tensile strength _R m_ for the material should be entered as given in ASME II, Part D, Subpart 1, Table 2A,2B,5A or 5B\(at room temperature\) or Table U\(at elevated temperature\).

# Shells & Heads
The following shell and head types may be selected:
### Cylindrical Shells
### Conical Shells
### Eccentric cones
Concentric conical shells with or without knuckles at the large and small ends may be specified. If the knuckle radius is zero then the program assumes that no knuckle is present.
Eccentric conical shells with or without knuckles at the large and small ends may be specified subject to the requirements of Figure 4.3.2. If the knuckle radius is zero then the program assumes that no knuckle is present.
The cone geometry may be defined by specifying either the cone half apex angle or alternatively the cone length. Whichever is specified the program will calculate the other dimension.

### Ellipsoidal Heads
Ellipsoidal heads may be selected as either a standard 2:1 ellipsoidal head where the height of the head \(measured from the tan-line\) is a quarter of the diameter of the head skirt, or a general ellipsoidal head where the head height is specified by the user. For a 2:1 head, if internal dimensions have been specified the inside head height is determined from the inside diameter, and for external dimensions the outside head height is determined from the outside diameter \(all in the uncorroded condition\).
### Hemispherical Heads
Hemispherical heads intended for connection to a cylindrical shell may be selected.
For spherical shells the hemispherical head option may be selected. Please note, however, that the calculated weight and volume will be for a hemispherical head.
### Torispherical Heads
Torispherical heads may be selected as either a standard DIN Korbbogen head, with a crown radius 80% of the head outside diameter and a knuckle radius approximately 15.4% of the outside diameter, or a general torispherical head where the crown and knuckle radii are specified by the user.

# External Pressure Charts
External pressure chart numbers are given for each ASME material specification and grade in ASME II, PART D, Subpart 1, TABLES 5A and 5B -see [\[1\]](<h9998.htm#0001>).
To avoid step changes in calculated values of factor _A_ and/or stress _B_ , the tabulated values given are used only when the proportional limit is exceeded. In all other cases values are calculated from the equation _B_ =_AE_ /2.

# Shell & Head stresses
ASME VIII Div. 2 Section 4.5.15 states that stress calculations should be in accordance with WRC 107 and/or WRC 297 and the acceptance criteria shall be in accordance with Part 5.
Pressure stress - For openings in shells ASME VIII Div.2 Section 5.5.6.1\(d\) suggests 3.0.
Shear stress - The recommended value of the multiplication factor to obtain the allowable shear stress in the shell is 0.6 - see ASME VIII Div.2 Section 4.5.14.
Membrane stress - The recommended value of the multiplication factor to obtain the allowable membrane stress in the shell is 1.5 - see ASME VIII Div.2 Section 5.2.2.4 and Figure 5.1. NOTE: If the membrane stress cannot be classified as a local primary membrane stress \(i.e. if the stress is not self-limiting\) then a value of 1.0 should be used - see ASME VIII Div.2 Table 5.6 and Figure 5.1.
Membrane plus bending stress - The recommended value of the multiplication factor to obtain the allowable membrane plus bending stress in the shell is 3.0 - see ASME VIII Div.2 Section 5.5.6.1\(d\). NOTE: If the stress cannot be classified as a secondary membrane plus bending stress \(i.e. if the stress is not self-limiting\) then a value of 1.5 should be used - see ASME VIII Div.2, Table 5.6 and Figure 5.1.
Surface stress - The recommended value of the multiplication factor to obtain the allowable surface stress in the shell is 3.0 - see ASME VIII Div.2 Section 5.5.6.1\(d\)
* * *
# Nozzle stresses
ASME VIII Div. 2 Section 4.5.15 states that stress calculations should be in accordance with WRC 107 and/or WRC 297 and the acceptance criteria shall be in accordance with Part 5.
Shear stress - Div.2 Section 5 does not refer to pure shear. Therefore the recommended value of the multiplication factor to obtain the allowable shear stress in the nozzle is 0.7 from ASME VIII Div.1, UG-45\(c\).
Membrane stress - The recommended value of the multiplication factor to obtain the allowable membrane stress in the nozzle is 1.0 - see ASME VIII Div.2 Section 5.2.2.4 and Figure 5.1. NOTE: The membrane stress in the nozzle cannot normally be classified as a local primary membrane stress - see ASME VIII Div.2 Table 5.6.
Membrane plus bending stress - The recommended value of the multiplication factor to obtain the allowable membrane plus bending stress in the nozzle is 1.5 - see ASME VIII Div.2 Section 5.2.2.4. NOTE: The membrane plus bending stress in the nozzle cannot normally be classified as a secondary membrane plus bending stress - see ASME VIII Div.2, Table 5.6.
Surface stress - The recommended value of the multiplication factor to obtain the allowable surface stress in the nozzle is 3.0 - see ASME VIII Div.2 Section 5.5.6.1\(d\)
