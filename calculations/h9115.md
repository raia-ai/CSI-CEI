## Additional Information

## Support Types

The following types of support are covered by the program: [Plain saddle](../h9988.htm#0010).\
[Internal ring](../h9988.htm#0020).\
[External ring](../h9988.htm#0020).\
[Adjacent internal rings](../h9988.htm#0030).\
[Adjacent external rings](../h9988.htm#0030).\
[Ring support](../h9988.htm#0040). Data from each saddle will be transferred to the other saddle as certain dimensions and selections have to be identical between the two saddles. Two saddles must be input.

## Error Messages

See also [General component error messages](../h9100.htm#1000).

| Distance between rings  | For a saddle with _Adjacent internal/external rings_ the distance between the rings is invalid, i.e the rings clash with the saddle/wrapper or the distance between them is greater than the shell radius. Or the _Base plate length_ is less than the _Bolt spacing_. |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Width                   | For a _Ring support_ saddle the distance between supports is greater than the shell diameter. For all other saddle types the _Saddle base width_ is greater than the _Base width_ - see [Saddle base details](../h9988.htm#1000).                                      |
| Height                  | An invalid saddle height has been input.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
