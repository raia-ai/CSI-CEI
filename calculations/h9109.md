# Cone data
## Data Input
Description | Enter the cone description.  
---|---  
Diameter: OD-ID-NB | Select option for input of shell diameter as _Nominal bore_ , _External_ or _Internal_. For standard pipe sizes to ANSI B36.10 or BS 1600 select _Nominal bore_ \- see [Nominal Pipe Sizes & Schedules](<h9986.htm>). For other diameters and/or thicknesses select _External_ or _Internal_ \- see [\[5\]](<h9998.htm#0005>) and [\[11\]](<h9998.htm#0011>).  
Tolerance | Select option for input of thickness tolerance as either _Absolute_ or _Percentage_.  
Thinning | Thinning allowance to cater for mill tolerance on cone material. This tolerance will be deducted from the new thickness.  
Insulation Thk | Thickness of any external insulation.  
Small end knuckle rad | Check this box to specify that the cone has a knuckle at the small end.  
Large end knuckle rad | Check this box to specify that the cone has a knuckle at the large end.  
Eccentric cone | Check this box to specify that the cone is eccentric/oblique.  
Inverted | Check this box to specify that the cone is inverted.  
Small end local thk | Check this box to specify an increased cone thickness at the small end.  
Large end local thk | Check this box to specify an increased cone thickness at the large end.  
Limpet coil | Check this box to specify that limpet coils are fitted to the cone.  
Cone Material | Shell material selection from the [Material Database](<h9996.htm>).  
Internal Space | Cone internal pressure space selection - see [Pressure Space](<h9103.htm>).  
## Additional Information
The straight flange length is calculated by the software as the difference between the location of the small/large end tanline and the location of the adjacent weld.
NOTE: If the model has been specified as _Vertical_ in [Item orientation](<h9303.htm>) and has [Base Plate data](<h9120.htm>) defined, then the maximum number of cones that can be added is limited to 5 - see [External Loads on Vertical Vessels](<h0012.htm#0306>). 
## Error Messages
See also [General component error messages](<h9100.htm#1000>).
Angle | An invalid cone apex angle and or length has been specified.  
---|---  
Conflicting thicknesses | An invalid cone thickness combination has been specified.  
Junction ring location | The location of one or more of the Large or Small end junction rings is invalid.  
Missing calculation data | An _Insulation thickness_ has been specified but no weight data has been input. To input this data select the ![](..\\img\\3ddefcalc.png) button from the toolbar and then select _Vertical Vessels_ \- see [Default calculation data](<h9133.htm>)  
Quantity | The maximum number of cones has been exceeded - see above.  
Radius | The cone small end or large end knuckle radius is invalid.
