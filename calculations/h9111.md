## Additional Information

In order for the software to calculate the external projecton of the nozzle a _Circumferencial Weld_ must be inserted after the nozzle. NOTE: For a _Pad_ type nozzle a _Circumferencial Weld_ is not required. To specify a _Plain_ opening in a Flat Cover, select a _Set-on_ , _Pad_ type nozzle. A _Gasket and Bolting_ component and then a _Flange_ may be inserted after a _Pad_ type nozzle.
