# ASME VIII Div.2 - Shells - Internal Pressure
# Cylindrical or Conical Shells & Heads
* * *
# Program Capabilities
This program performs the calculations for cylindrical and conical shells and formed heads subject to internal pressure in accordance with ASME VIII Div.2 Part 4. NOTE: All design stress are time-independant.
Weld joint efficiency is determined from Table 7.2
Hydrostatic test pressures are calculated in accordance with Part 8.2. The MAWP of the vessel component is calculated both in the new and cold condition and in the hot and corroded condition.
The program also calculates the internal volume and empty weight of the shell, cone or head. The weight and volume for a dished head is calculated up to the tan-line and includes the head skirt \(cylindrical portion\).
All shell and head types may be specified by either inside or outside diameter. All thicknesses are entered in the new or as built condition. A thinning allowance may be specified either as a percentage of the new thickness or as an absolute value in mm or inches. The thinning allowance is always applied to the inside surface. Both internal and external corrosion allowances may be specified as required.
Due to the limitations of data input the minimum thickness requirements of Part 4.1.2, paragraphs a\) thru d\), are not checked.
Cones may be specified with different thicknesses at the large and small ends. All material parameters are determined using the thicker thickness. The maximum diameter that the thinner thickness may extend to is calculated.

# Operation
## Cylindrical Shells
The program calculates the minimum required thickness and allowable pressure for a cylindrical shell under internal pressure. Currently applied external loads and moments are not included.
## Conical Shells
An external axial tensile force and/or an external bending moment may be entered for use in the large and small end calculations - see 4.3.13 for definitions of _F_ and _M_.
For conical shells without a knuckle at the large end the required thickness of the cone is calculated in accordance with 4.3.11.
For conical shells with a knuckle at the large end the required thickness of the conical portion is calculated in accordance with 4.3.12. The limitations on knuckle & flare dimensions in 4.3.12 are also checked.
Below is an example of data input for cone locations, one with stiffeners at either end and one without - see also [Conical Shells](<h9987.htm>).

---|---  
Code limitations exceeded |  One or more of the following limitations have been exceeded: 
* If any of the limits in 4.3.11.4\(c\) or 4.3.11.5\(c\) are not satisfied then the cylinder to cone junction shall be designed in accordance with Part 5.
* If any of the limits in 4.3.6.1\(b\) or 4.3.7.1 are not satisfied then the head shall be designed in accordance with Part 5.
