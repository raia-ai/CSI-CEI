# Flat Cover data
## Data Input
Description | Enter the cover description.  
---|---  
Type | Select the type of flat head or cover - see [Flat Cover Types](<h9991.htm>)  
Thinning | Enter the thinning allowance to be applied to the cover.  
ASME Rated flange calc | Select _No_ to use the methodology in UG-34/Paragraph 4.6, or _Yes_ to evaluate a rated flange to ASME. **NOTE: If this option is set to _Yes_ a Rated flange must be selected from the folowing menu.**  
Standard flange data | Import [Standard Flange Data](<h9982.htm>).  
Facing | Select the required cover facing type - see [Facing & Gasket Data](<h9985.htm>)  
Facing configuration | Select the required facing configuration as _Raised_ , _Flat_ or _Recessed_. NOTE: Not all facing configurations are available for each facing type.  
Internally confined gasket | Check this box for an internally confined gasket.  
Bolt hole dia | Enter the diameter of the bolt hole in the flange.  
Quantity | Enter the quantity of bolts.  
Cover Material | Cover material selection from the [Material Database](<h9996.htm>).  
## Additional Information
For Flat Cover types [Welded: Type 1](<h9991.htm#0001>),[Welded: Type 6](<h9991.htm#0006>),[Welded: Type 7](<h9991.htm#0007>),[Welded: Type 8](<h9991.htm#0008>),[Welded: Type 9](<h9991.htm#0009>),[Welded: Type 10](<h9991.htm#0010>) and [Welded: Type 11](<h9991.htm#0015>) the shell diameter is the same as the adjacent shell or nozzle.
For Flat Cover types [Welded: Type 2](<h9991.htm#0002>),[Welded: Type 3](<h9991.htm#0003>),[Welded: Type 4](<h9991.htm#0004>) and [Welded: Type 5](<h9991.htm#0005>) the shell thickness is input.
NOTE: Flat Cover types [Bolted: Type 3](<h9991.htm#0013>) and [Bolted: Type 4](<h9991.htm#0014>) are not currently supported by Finglow 3D, these types can be computed using Finglow 2D.
## Error Messages
See also [General component error messages](<h9100.htm#1000>).
Component mismatch | A _Flat cover_ must have a [Gasket & Bolting](<h9128.htm>) component adjacent to it if its a Bolted type of cover, or the combination of Welded type covers and [Circumferential weld](<h9113.htm>) as described above is invalid.  
---|---  
Confining/facing height | The Facing has been defined as an _Internally confined gasket_ but no _confining height_ has been input, or no _facing height_ has been input  
Conflicting facings | For a _Bolted: Type 1_ cover a _Full Faced_ facing type cannot be selected, or for a _Bolted : Type 2_ cover the facing on the adjacent component can only be _Full Faced_ or _Metal to Metal_ , or One or more of the facing dimensions doesn't match the other or is invalid, alternatively the facing configurations are incompatible - see [Facing & Gasket Data](<h9985.htm>).  
Cover dimensions | The Cover diameter and/or thickness is invalid.  
Height | The Facing has been defined as either _Raised_ or _Recessed_ but no _facing height_ has been input.  
Length | For a _Welded : Type 3_ cover the _Straight taper length_ is less than or equal to the _Taper length_ \- see [Welded: Type 3](<h9991.htm#0003>). For all other welded types the distance between the adjacent weld and the cover is insufficient to accommodate any welds or radius present.  
Radius | An invalid corner radius has been input, or for a _Welded : Type 3_ the radius is less than the cover thk.
