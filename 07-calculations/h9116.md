# Tubesheet data
## Data Input
Standard flange data | Import [Standard Flange Data](<h9982.htm>).  
---|---  
Description | Enter the tubesheet description.  
Thinning | Enter the thinning allowance to be applied to the tubesheet.  
Edge bolted | Select _Yes_ if the tubesheet is extended for bolting. If this option is set to _Yes_ then a moment due to the bolt load will be applied to the edge of the tubesheet.  
Tubeside data | Heading to denote the following facing data applies to the tubeside of the tubesheet  
Raised stub: tubeside | Select _Yes_ if a raised stub is provided for a butt welded channel connection - see [Welded Tubesheet Connections](<h9989.htm#0200>).  
Facing | Select the required cover facing type - see [Facing & Gasket Data](<h9985.htm>)  
Facing configuration | Select the required facing configuration as _Raised_ , _Flat_ or _Recessed_. NOTE: Not all facing configurations are available for each facing type.  
Internally confined gasket | Check this box for an internally confined gasket.  
Shellside data | Heading to denote the following facing data applies to the shellside of the tubesheet  
Raised stub: shellside | Select _Yes_ if a raised stub is provided for a butt welded shell connection - see [Welded Tubesheet Connections](<h9989.htm#0200>).  
Facing | Select the required cover facing type - see [Facing & Gasket Data](<h9985.htm>)  
Facing configuration | Select the required facing configuration as _Raised_ , _Flat_ or _Recessed_. NOTE: Not all facing configurations are available for each facing type.  
Internally confined gasket | Check this box for an internally confined gasket.  
Tubesheet Material | Tubesheet material selection from the [Material Database](<h9996.htm>).  
Bolt hole dia | The diameter of the bolt hole in the flange, this has been transfered from the adjacent flange and is for information only and cannot be changed.  
Quantity | The quantity of bolts, this has been transfered from the adjacent flange and is for information only and cannot be changed.  
## Additional Information
The type of tubesheet is determined by the software, and is dependant on the adjacent compononets that have been input.
The location of the second tubesheet is calculated by the software and is based on the length of the attached [Tube bundle data](<h9129.htm>).
Two tubesheets must be input, and must be of the same thickness.
To specify a tubesheet that has a shell with the thickness increased adjacent to the tubesheet, the user must insert a cylindrical shell section and ensure its thickness is greater than the adjacent shell.
## Error Messages
See also [General component error messages](<h9100.htm#1000>).
Component mismatch | A _Tubesheet_ must have either a [Circumferential weld](<h9113.htm>) or a [Gasket & Bolting](<h9128.htm>) component adjacent to it, having any other component present will result in this message. There must also be a [Cylinder](<h9107.htm>) present on the shellside and either a [Cylinder](<h9107.htm>) or a [Formed head](<h9108.htm>) on the tubeside of the tubesheet.  
---|---  
Confining/facing height | The Facing has been defined as an _Internally confined gasket_ but no _confining height_ has been input, or no _facing height_ has been input  
Conflicting facings | One or more of the facing dimensions doesn't match the other or is invalid, alternatively the facing configurations are incompatible - see [Facing & Gasket Data](<h9985.htm>).  
Conflicting thicknesses | The _Tubesheet thickness_ is invalid after the deduction of the input facing heights, or if a locally thickened shell has been specified, the shell thickness must be greater than the adjacent shell.  
Height | The Facing has been defined as either _Raised_ or _Recessed_ but no _facing height_ has been input.  
Length | If a locally thickened shell has been specified, the length of this shell needs to be long enough to accomadate a 1:4 slope.  
Outer tube limit | The OTL of the bundle is greater than or equal too the inside diameter of the channel or shell, or the tubesheet outside diameter.  
Tubesheet dimensions | The Tubesheet diameter and/or thickness is invalid.
