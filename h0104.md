# ASME VIII Div.1 - Saddle & Ring Supports
* * *
# Program Capabilities
This program performs the calculations for the stresses in cylindrical horizontal vessels supported on two symmetrically located saddles in accordance with ASME VIII Div.1 Appendix G-6 and G-9, and the paper "Stresses in Large Horizontal Cylindrical Pressure Vessels on Two Saddle Supports" by L. P. Zick [\[31\]](<h9998.htm#0031>). Calculations for ring type supports are performed in accordance with PD 5500 Appendix G, section G.3.3 - see [\[13\]](<h9998.htm#0013>).
See [External Loads on Horizontal Vessels](<h0113.htm>) for asymmetrically located saddles or vessels with additional external loads.
The joint efficiency _E_ is evaluated by the program in accordance with UW-12 for the type of weld and level of radiography specified. The maximum allowable longitudinal compressive stress for the shell is calculated in accordance with UG-23\(b\), with the factor _B_ being evaluated from the figures and tables in ASME II, PART D, Subpart 3 - see [\[1\]](<h9998.htm#0001>). The compressive yield point for the shell material is evaluated in accordance with UG-23.
The program calculates the internal volume of the shell and heads in the uncorroded condition, and hence the weight of the liquid contents for a specified liquid level and specific gravity. The membrane stresses due to internal and external pressure are also calculated.
The shell and head may be specified by either inside or outside diameter. All thicknesses are entered in the new or as built condition. Thinning allowances may be specified for the shell and the heads, either as a percentage of the new thickness or as an absolute value in mm or inches. The thinning allowance is always applied to the inside surface. Both internal and external corrosion allowances may be specified as required.

# Operation
## Weld Types and Radiography
Weld types and radiography are specified in the same way as for shells under internal pressure - see [Weld Types](<h0198.htm#0300>) and [Radiography](<h0198.htm#0500>). The diameter and thickness limits are checked as detailed in [Diameter and Thickness Limits](<h0198.htm#0700>).
## Joint Efficiency
For the longitudinal and circumferential welds in the shell the joint efficiencies are determined from TABLE UW-12 for the specified joint types and radiography. If the longitudinal weld radiography is set at _Full_ , and the circumferential weld radiography is set at _None_ , then the joint efficiency for the longitudinal weld is reduced to the value from column \(b\) in TABLE UW-12 - see UW-12\(a\). This does not apply if the circumferential joint is seamless.
When the longitudinal joint is specified as seamless, the joint efficiency for the longitudinal joint \(or more correctly, the quality factor\) is determined in accordance with UW-12\(d\). It should be noted that, if no radiography is specified for the circumferential weld then the longitudinal joint efficiency is reduced to 0.85. This does not apply if the circumferential joint is seamless.
NOTE: The joint efficiency for the longitudinal weld is only used to check the required the shell thickness for the internal pressure. The joint efficiency _E_ which is output is for the circumferential weld and is used to evaluate the allowable longitudinal tensile stress in the shell.
## Support Types
The following types of support are covered by the program: 
[Plain saddle](<h9988.htm#0010>)
[Internal ring](<h9988.htm#0020>)
[External ring](<h9988.htm#0020>)
[Adjacent internal rings](<h9988.htm#0030>)
[Adjacent external rings](<h9988.htm#0030>)
[Ring support](<h9988.htm#0040>)
All support types may be welded to the shell or loose, except ring supports which are assumed to be welded. Saddle angles from 30° to 180° are permitted by the program, but it should be noted that Appendix G-6 requires the saddle to extend over at least one third of the circumference of the shell, which is equivalent to a saddle angle of 120°. Saddles outside this range would require careful consideration. This requirement is checked by the program.
## Cylindrical Shell
When the thickness does not exceed half the inside radius _R_ the membrane stresses due to pressure are calculated in accordance with UG-27\(c\). For greater thicknesses Appendix 1-2 is used. In both cases the equations are re-arranged to give the stress _S_.
## Dished Heads
### Ellipsoidal Heads
The stress due to pressure is calculated in accordance with Appendix 1-4\(c\), by re-arranging the equations to give the stress _S_.
### Hemispherical Heads
When the thickness does not exceed 0.356 _L_ the membrane stress due to pressure is calculated in accordance with UG-32\(e\). For greater thicknesses Appendix 1-3 is used. In both cases the equations are re-arranged to give the stress _S_.
### Torispherical Heads
The stress due to pressure is calculated in accordance with Appendix 1-4\(d\), by re-arranging the equations to give the stress _S_.
## External Pressure
NOTE: No special analysis of the shell is performed by this module for vessels subject to external pressure. The program will calculate the compressive membrane stresses in the shell due to the external pressure.
The shell must be separately checked for the external pressure condition using the _Shells_ \- _External Pressure_ module. It should be noted that deformation of the shell adjacent to the saddles due to the weight of the vessel and its contents may exceed the permissible out-of-roundness specified in UG-80. Ring supports are preferable to saddle supports for vacuum vessels.
## Extended Wrapper Plates
If the calculated circumferential stresses in the shell are too high, then they can be reduced by fitting a wrapper plate or wear plate. The width of the wrapper plate should not be less than the saddle width _b_ plus 10 times the shell thickness _t_ , and the wrapper plate must extend a distance _r_ / 10 above the horn of the saddle, where r is the mean radius of the shell. The distance _r_ / 10 is equivalent to approximately 6° therefore the wrapper plate angle should be at least equal to the saddle angle plus 12°. If the wrapper plate angle exceeds 180° then the calculations will be performed for a wrapper plate angle of 180°. The wrapper plate is normally made the same thickness as the shell.
If a wrapper plate is specified then the minimum required wrapper angle and width will be checked. If either the angle or the width is insufficient the wrapper will be ignored. If both the wrapper angle and width are sufficient then the relevant stresses are calculated in the wrapper at the edge of the saddle, using the combined shell and wrapper thickness, and also in the shell at the edge of the wrapper.
## Stiffening Rings
Additional stiffening of the shell may be provided by means of stiffening rings which may be positioned either externally or internally. The [Specification of Stiffening Rings](<h9990.htm>) is the same as that for the _Shells - External Pressure_ module. The relevant corrosion allowance is deducted from all surfaces of stiffeners.
NOTE: Wrapper plates, as detailed in Extended Wrapper Plates, are not considered to form part of any attached stiffening ring.
When specifying internal or external rings adjacent to the saddles, it is assumed that there is a total of four rings, one either side of each saddle, and that all rings are of the same section. The information entered relates to one of the four identical rings. The distance between the stiffening rings adjacent to each saddle must be greater than the saddle width _b_ plus 10 times the shell thickness _t_ , and less than the shell mean radius _r_ \- see Fig. 9 in the Zick paper.
## Ring Type Supports
[Ring Support](<h9988.htm#0040>) are used where it is important to ensure that the shell close to the supports remains round. This applies particularly to thin walled vessels which may distort excessively due to the weight of the vessel and contents, and to vessels subject to vacuum.
## Factors
Factors _K_ 1, _K_ 2, _K_ 4, _K_ 5, _K_ 7 and _K_ 8 are calculated in accordance with the equations in the Appendix to the Zick paper. Factor _K_ 3 is evaluated from Fig. 7 and factor _K_ 6 is obtained from Table 1 in the Zick paper.
Factors _K_ 10 and _K_ 11 for ring supports are evaluated in accordance with PD 6497 section 10 - see [\[15\]](<h9998.htm#0015>).
## Calculated and Allowable Stresses
### Longitudinal Stresses
The longitudinal stresses at mid-span between the supports are calculated at the top and bottom of the shell. The longitudinal stresses at the supports are calculated at the top of the shell when the shell is stiffened by rings or by proximity of the ends \(_A_ not greater than _r_ / 2\), or near the equator when the shell is unstiffened; and at the bottom of the shell. The longitudinal stresses _S_ 1 include the membrane stress due to pressure acting at the centre-line of the vessel, and are evaluated for both the internal and external pressure conditions.
The maximum tensile values are checked against an allowable value of _SE_ \(allowable stress at the design temperature multiplied by the joint efficiency for the circumferential weld\).
The maximum compressive stresses are checked against the allowable longitudinal compressive stress in accordance with UG-23\(b\).
Values for elastic modulus _E_ and factor _B_ are provided automatically by the program for a range of carbon and low alloy steels, austenitic steels and non-ferrous materials from the figures and tables in ASME II, PART D, Subpart 3.
### Tangential Shearing Stresses
The tangential shearing stress _S_ 2 in the shell is calculated at the edge of the support, with the shear force at the edge of the saddle closest to the mid-point of the vessel normally being the higher value.
NOTE: When the saddle is past the quarter point of the vessel \(_A_ greater than _L_ / 4\), the shear force at the outer edge of the saddle \(closest to the vessel end\) will be the higher and in this case the formula in the Zick paper is not correct - see BSI Document PD 6497 clause 6.2.
Where the shell is considered to be stiffened by the dished head \(_A_ not greater than _r_ / 2\), the tangential shearing stress _S_ 2 in the head and the additional stress _S_ 4 in the head are also calculated.
The allowable tangential shearing stresses in the shell and head are 0.8 _S_ , where _S_ is the allowable stress for the shell or head as applicable.
The additional stress _S_ 4 in the head is checked against an allowable of \(1.25 _S_ \- pressure stress in head\).
### Circumferential Stresses
For plain saddles and for rings adjacent to the saddle, circumferential stresses _S_ 5 are calculated at the bottom of the shell at the edge of the support and at the edge of the wrapper \(when fitted\), and are checked against the lower of the shell allowable stress _S_ or the compressive yield point. The circumferential stresses _S_ 3 at the horn of the saddle are calculated at the edge of the support and at the edge of the wrapper \(when fitted\), and are checked against an allowable stress of 1.25 _S_.
The circumferential stresses _S_ 6 in the shell and in the flange or the tip of the ring remote from the shell are calculated at the horn of the saddle \(for vessels with rings in the plane of the saddle\) or near the equator \(for rings adjacent to the saddle\). These stresses are checked against the lower of 1.25 _S_ or 1.25 times the stiffener allowable stress.
For ring supports the maximum circumferential stress _S_ 10 in the ring is checked against the lower of _S_ or the stiffener allowable stress.
