* * *
# Program Capabilities
This program performs the calculations for the assessment of stresses due to local loading on cylindrical shells in accordance with ASME VIII Div.2 Section 4.5.15, Welding Research Council Bulletin 107/537 "Local Stresses in Spherical and Cylindrical Shells due to External Loadings" [\[35\]](<h9998.htm#0035>), Welding Research Council Bulletin 297 "Local Stresses in Cylindrical Shells due to External Loadings on Nozzles [\[30\]](<h9998.htm#0030>) and STP-PT-074 "Local Stresses in Nozzles, in Shells and Formed Heads from External Loads" [\[39\]](<h9998.htm#0039>).
The nomenclature used in the program output is generally in accordance with WRC 107/537 sections 1.1 and 1.3, and WRC 297 section 1.0, except that the subscript _y_ is used in place of f and _S_ is used in place of s.
The stresses in the shell at the edge of a nozzle and the stresses in the nozzle are calculated to WRC 297 sections 3.1 and 3.3. The stresses at the edge of a solid attachment or at the edge of a reinforcing pad or insert plate are calculated to WRC 107/537 section 4. The membrane stresses due to internal pressure are calculated to Section 4.3.10. The summation of stresses is in accordance with WRC 107/537 Table 5.
The membrane stresses in the nozzle neck due the combined effect of pressure and external loads are checked by the program. The calculation method employed is described in PD 5500 Annex B. External moments and shear forces are combined vectorially as applicable. A warning message is displayed if the allowable design stress is exceeded.
For a nozzle without a reinforcing pad, the deflection and rotations are evaluated using the factors from WRC 297 Figures 59 and 60. In all other cases the deflection is evaluated using factors derived from Table 1 of "Stresses from Radial Loads in Cylindrical Pressure Vessels" [\[22\]](<h9998.htm#0022>) and the rotations are evaluated using factors from Figures 3 and 7 of "Stresses from Radial Loads and External Moments in Cylindrical Pressure Vessels" [\[23\]](<h9998.htm#0023>).
The shell may be specified by either inside or outside diameter. Nozzles may be specified by nominal bore, inside diameter or outside diameter. All thicknesses are entered in the new or as built condition. Thinning allowance may be specified for the shell and the nozzles, either as a percentage of the new thickness or as an absolute value in mm or inches. Thinning allowances are always applied to the inside surface. Both internal and external corrosion allowances may be specified as required.
The method in WRC 107/537 can be selected when performing calculations on nozzles, the stresses will be calculated as per WRC 107/537 section 4 at the edge of a round attachment only, with the addition of a stress concentration factor applied to the pressure stress adjacent to the attachment only.

# Operation
## Attachment Types
The following types of attachment are covered by the program: 
  * _Opening or nozzle_ \- The following types of nozzles and openings may be selected - see [Nozzle Types](<h9993.htm#0500>): 
_Plain nozzle_
_Nozzle + single pad_
_Nozzle + double pad_
_Self reinforced_
_Butt welded insert_
_Pad_
* _Solid circular_ \- A circular attachment which does not penetrate the shell. NOTE: The attachment itself may be hollow, as in the case of a lifting trunnion, but the stresses are calculated as if the attachment was solid.  
* _Rectangular_ \- A rectangular attachment. NOTE: The attachment itself may be hollow, as in the case of a "box" type support bracket, but the stresses are calculated as if the attachment was solid.  
* _Square_ \- A square attachment \(equal length and width\). The attachment may be hollow as in the case of a rectangular attachment.
**NOTE:** Only Plain nozzle and Nozzle + single pad can be selected when using the STP-PT-074 method.
## Joint Efficiency
For the purposes of assessing the stress in the shell the joint efficiency _E_ is assumed to be 1.0, as the loads are considered to be remote from any main weld. Any variation of _E_ should be entered by adjusting the value of allowable stress. 
## Loadings and Sign Convention
The following loadings may be specified for any type of attachment: see [Loadings and Sign Convention Shells](<h9981.htm#0010>). 
  * _Load X \(long shear\)_ \- This corresponds to the load _V_ L in WRC 107/537 and WRC 297.  
  * _Load Y \(circ shear\)_ \- This corresponds to the load _V_ C in WRC 107/537 and WRC 297.  
  * _Load Z \(radial\)_ \- This corresponds to the load _P_ in WRC 107/537 and WRC 297. NOTE: The sign convention for the load _P_ in WRC 107/537 is opposite to that used by this program and by WRC 297. **NOTE:** This is the axial load as specified in STP-PT-074 Figure 4.5.13.  
  * _Moment X \(circ\)_ \- This corresponds to the moment _M_ C in WRC 107/537 and WRC 297. NOTE: The sign convention for the moment _M_ C in WRC 107/537 is opposite to that used by this program and by WRC 297. **NOTE:** This is the In-Plane moment as specified in STP-PT-074 Figure 4.5.13.  
  * _Moment Y \(long\)_ \- This corresponds to the moment _M_ L in WRC 107/537 and WRC 297. **NOTE:** This is the Out-of-Plane moment as specified in STP-PT-074 Figure 4.5.13.  
  * _Moment Z \(torsion\)_ \- This corresponds to the moment _M_ T in WRC 107/537 and WRC 297. **NOTE:** This is the Torsional moment as specified in STP-PT-074 Figure 4.5.13.
## Rotation of Axes
The program includes a facility for converting the loading data from any arbitrary set of axes to those defined in [Loadings and Sign Convention Shells](<h9981.htm#0010>). This type of rotation is typically required for offset radial nozzles.
This is achieved by rotation about each axis as required. The operation of this facility is explained in [Rotation of Axes Example](<h9981.htm#0030>).
## Equivalent Length of Shell
If the nozzle or attachment is not located mid-way between the ends of the shell an equivalent length _L_ is calculated as follows:
For nozzles the equivalent length is calculated in accordance with WRC 297 section 1.0:
![](..\\img\\q0004.png)
where _L_ 1 and _L_ 2 are the distances from the nozzle centre-line to the ends of the shell.
For solid attachments the equivalent length is calculated in accordance with "Stresses from Radial Loads in Cylindrical Pressure Vessels" by P. P. Bijlaard:
![](..\\img\\q0005.png)
where _l_ is the actual length of the shell and _x_ is the distance from one end.
NOTE: For solid attachments the equivalent length is only used in the deflection calculations.
## Internal Pressure
Optionally a stress concentration factor can be input to take account of the effects of any opening. Alternatively the program will calculate a scf based on PD 5500 W.6.2.2.3.
#### WRC Method
For all types of nozzle and other attachments the longitudinal and circumferential membrane stresses in the shell due to internal pressure are calculated and added to the stresses in the shell due to the local loads. When a reinforcing pad or insert plate is specified the pressure stresses are calculated using the combined head and pad thickness.
For nozzles the longitudinal and circumferential membrane stresses in the nozzle due to internal pressure are calculated and added to the stresses in the nozzle due to the local loads.
The membrane stresses due to pressure are calculated in accordance with Section 4.3.10.
#### STP-PT-074 Method
For all types of nozzle the nominal stresse in the shell due to internal pressure is calculated. When a reinforcing pad is specified the pressure stress is calculated using a combinedation of shell and pad thickness.
## Calculation of Stresses
### Edge of Nozzle
#### WRC Method
The stresses in the shell at the edge of a nozzle are calculated to WRC 297 section 3.1 equations \(1\) to \(4\), and section 3.3 equations \(9\) and \(10\). For butt welded insert nozzles the shell thickness _T_ is taken as the corroded thickness of the insert plate. For nozzles with reinforcing pads the thickness _T_ is taken as the combined shell plus pad thickness, less corrosion and thinning allowance.
NOTE: The specified thinning allowance is not applied to reinforcing pads and insert plates.
The stress resultants _n_ r , _m_ r , _n_ θand _m_ θare evaluated from the figures in WRC 297 as shown in the table below.
**Applied load or moment** | **Stress resultant** | **WRC 297 Figure**  
---|---|---  
Load _P_ \(Load Z\) | _n_ r _= N_ r _T / P_ | 8 to 12  
Load _P_ \(Load Z\) | _m_ r _= M_ r _/ P_ | 3 to 7  
Load _P_ \(Load Z\) | _n_ θ _= N_ θ _T / P_ | 18 to 22  
Load _P_ \(Load Z\) | _m_ θ _= M_ θ _/ P_ | 13 to 17  
Moment _M_ C \(Moment X\) | _n_ r _= N_ r _T_ d _/ M_ C | 27 to 31  
Moment _M_ C \(Moment X\) | _m_ r _= M_ r _d / M_ C | 23 to 26  
Moment _M_ C \(Moment X\) | _n_ θ _= N_ θ _Td / M_ C | 36 to 40  
Moment _M_ C \(Moment X\) | _n_ θ _= M_ θ _d / M_ C | 32 to 35  
Moment _M_ L \(Moment Y\) | _n_ r _= N_ r _Td / M_ L | 45 to 49  
Moment _M_ L \(Moment Y\) | _m_ r _= M_ r _d / M_ L | 41 to 44  
Moment _M_ L \(Moment Y\) | _n_ θ _= N_ θ _Td / M_ L | 54 to 58  
Moment _M_ L \(Moment Y\) | _m_ θ _= M_ θ _d / M_ L | 50 to 53  
Logarithmic interpolation is used for parameters λ and _d_ / _t_. Linear interpolation is used for _T_ / _t_. If λ is less than 0.01 or greater than 10.0 the value of the stress resultant at the limit value of λ is used. If _d_ / _t_ is less than 10.0 or greater than 100.0 the value of the stress resultant at the limit value of _d_ / _t_ is used. If _T_ / _t_ is greater than 10.0 the value of the stress resultant at the limit value of _T_ / _t_ is used. Appropriate warning messages will be produced if any of these parameters are out of range.
The data used by the program includes extrapolations of the curves in WRC 297. If any extrapolated values are used a warning message will be produced.
#### STP-PT-074 Method
The stresses in the shell at the edge of a nozzle are calculated to 4.5.15. For nozzles with reinforcing pads the thickness is taken as a combination of shell plus pad thickness, less corrosion and thinning allowance.
NOTE: The specified thinning allowance is not applied to reinforcing pads.
Cofficients C1 - C30 are calculated using Tables 4.5.4 through 4.5.93, using the parameters specified in Table 4.5.2.
### In Nozzle
#### WRC Method
The stresses in the nozzle at the nozzle to shell junction are calculated to either WRC107/537 or WRC 297 subsection 3.1 equations \(5\), \(6\) and \(7\), and subsection 3.3 equations \(11\) and \(12\).
NOTE: The circumferential bending stresses in the nozzle are assumed to be negligible - see WRC 297 subsection 3.1.
#### STP-PT-074 Method
The stresses in the nozzle at the nozzle to shell junction are calculated to 4.5.15.
### Edge Of Solid Attachment
The stresses in the shell at the edge of a solid attachment are calculated to WRC 107/537 section 4. For attachments with insert plates the shell thickness _T_ is taken as the corroded thickness of the insert plate. For attachments with reinforcing pads the thickness _T_ is taken as the combined shell plus pad thickness, less corrosion and thinning allowance. For attachments with pads pressure stress is considered to act in the shell only.
NOTE: The specified thinning allowance is not applied to reinforcing pads and insert plates.
The value of the shell parameter γ is calculated to WRC 107/537, subsection 4.2.1. For solid circular or square attachments the parameter β is calculated to subsection 4.2.2.1 or 4.2.2.2.
For rectangular attachments values of the parameter β are calculated for the radial load _P_ to subsection 4.2.2.3, using factors _K_ 1 and _K_ 2 obtained from Table 6. For the moment _M_ C values of β are calculated to subsection 4.2.2.4, using values of factor _K_ C obtained from Table 7. For the moment _M_ L values of β are calculated to subsection 4.2.2.5, using values of factor _K_ L obtained from Table 8.
Logarithmic interpolation is used in Tables 7 and 8 for the parameter γ and the ratios β1 / β2 and β2 / β1. If γ is less than 15.0 or greater than 300.0 the factors at the limit value of γ are used. If the ratios β1 / β2 or β2 / β1 are less than 0.25 or greater than 4.0 the value of the factors at the limit values of the ratios are used. Appropriate warning messages will be produced if either of these parameters are out of range.
The dimensionless membrane forces and bending moments are evaluated from the figures in WRC 107/537 as shown in the table below.
**Applied load or moment** | **Dimensionless force** | **WRC 107/537 Figure**  
---|---|---  
| **or bending moment** | **Longitudinal axis** | **Transverse axis**  
Load _P_ | _N_ f _/ \(P / R_ m _\)_ | 4C | 3C  
Load _P_ | _M_ f _/ P_ | 2C-1 | 1C  
Load _P_ | _N_ x _/ \(P / R_ m _\)_ | 3C | 4C  
Load _P_ | _M_ x _/ P_ | 1C-1 | 2C  
Moment _M_ C | _N_ f _/_\(_M_ C _/ R_ m2β\) | - | 3A  
Moment _M_ C | _M_ f _/ \(M_ C _/ R_ m _β\)_ | - | 1A  
Moment _M_ C | _N_ x _/ \(M_ C _/ R_ m2β\) | - | 4A  
Moment _M_ C | _M_ x _/ \(M_ C _/ R_ mβ\) | - | 2A  
Moment _M_ L | _N_ f _/ \(M_ L _/ R_ m2β\) | 3B | -  
Moment _M_ L | _M_ f _/ \(M_ L _/ R_ mβ\) | 1B-1 | -  
Moment _M_ L | _N_ x _/ \(M_ L _/ R m_2β\) | 4B | -  
Moment _M_ L | _M_ x ___/ \(M_ L _/ R_ mβ\) | 2B-1 | -  
Logarithmic interpolation is used for the parameter γ and linear interpolation is used for the parameter β. If γ is less than 5.0 or greater than 300.0 the value of the dimensionless membrane force or moment at the limit value of γ is used. If β is greater than 0.5 the value of the dimensionless membrane force or moment at the limit value of β is used. Appropriate warning messages will be produced if either of these parameters are out of range.
The data used by the program includes extrapolations of the curves in WRC 107/537. If any extrapolated values or values from the dotted part of the curves are used a warning message will be produced.
For rectangular attachments the values of the dimensionless membrane forces _N_ f / \(_M_ C / _R m_2β\) and _N_ x / \(_M_ C / _R m_2β\) due to moment _M_ C are multiplied by the appropriate values of factor _C_ C obtained from Table 7, and the dimensionless membrane forces _N_ f / \(_M_ L / _R m_2β\) and _N_ x / \(_M_ L / _R m_2β\) due to moment _M_ L are multiplied by the appropriate values of factor _C_ L obtained from Table 8.
Shear stresses are calculated in accordance with WRC 107/537 subsection 4.3.5.1 for solid circular attachments, and 4.3.5.2 for square or rectangular attachments. The shear stress due to the torsional moment _M_ T on a square or rectangular attachment is calculated using the following formula:
![](..\\img\\q0006.png)
### Edge Of Reinforcing Pad Or Insert Plate
#### WRC Method
The stresses in the shell at the edge of a reinforcing pad or insert plate are calculated to WRC 107/537 section 4, as for the stresses at the edge of a solid attachment. The edge of an insert plate is taken as the large end of the taper, and the shell thickness _T_ is taken as the shell thickness less corrosion and thinning allowance.
#### STP-PT-074 Method
The stresses in the shell at the edge of a reinforcing pad or insert plate are calculated to 4.5.15.
Cofficients C1 - C30 are calculated using Tables 4.5.4 through 4.5.93, using the parameters specified in Table 4.5.2.
## Stress Summation
The summation of the stresses at the edge of the nozzle or attachment, due to the various loads and moments, is carried out at the inside and outside surface of the shell or pad at four points around the nozzle or attachment in accordance with WRC 107/537 Table 5. Points A and B are on the longitudinal axis \(X axis\) and points C and D are on the circumferential axis \(Y axis\) through the centre of the attachment.
When a pad or insert plate is fitted the summation of stresses is likewise carried out at the inside and outside surfaces of the shell at the edge of the pad or insert plate.
For a nozzle, the summation of stresses is also carried out at the outside and inside surfaces of the nozzle at the nozzle to shell junction.
The stresses at points A and B due to the circumferential moment _M_ C are assumed to be zero, and similarly, the stresses at points C and D due to the longitudinal moment _M_ L are assumed to be zero.
The + and - signs in the WRC 107/537 Table 5 indicate whether the calculated stress at that point should be multiplied by +1 or -1.
NOTE: The circumferential and longitudinal membrane stresses due to internal pressure are included in the stress summation. The software will check the membrane stress due to loadings combined with the plain pressure stress. The resultant membrane stress intensity is then checked _._
## Stress Intensities
The total circumferential and longitudinal membrane stresses, σmφ \(_S_ my\) and σmx \(_S_ mx\), are combined with the total shear stress, τ \(tau\), and the membrane stress intensity _S_ m is taken as the largest absolute value of stresses _S_ m1, _S_ m2 and _S_ m3 which are calculated as follows:
![](..\\img\\q0007.png)
![](..\\img\\q0008.png)
![](..\\img\\q0009.png)
Similarly, the total circumferential and longitudinal membrane plus bending stresses, σφ \(_S_ y\) and σx \(_S_ x\), are combined with the total shear stress, τ \(tau\), and the total stress intensity _S_ is taken as the largest absolute value of stresses _S_ 1, _S_ 2 and _S_ 3 which are calculated as follows:
![](..\\img\\q0010.png)
![](..\\img\\q0011.png)
![](..\\img\\q0012.png)
## Allowable Stresses
The allowable values for shear stress, membrane stress intensity and total membrane plus bending stress intensity are determined by multiplying the maximum allowable stress for the appropriate material by factors which are specified by the user. The recommended values for these factors are given below. If zero is entered for one or more of the factors then the message Invalid data will be displayed and the recommended value will be inserted into the input. Values which exceed twice the recommended values are not permitted.
### Shell Stresses
See - [Shell & Head Stresses](<h0598.htm#1200>)
### Nozzle Stresses
See - [Nozzle Stresses](<h0598.htm#1300>)
## Deflection and Rotations
For a nozzle without a reinforcing pad, the deflection _D_ z due to the radial load _P_ is evaluated using the factor a from WRC 297 Figure 59, and the rotations _R_ x and _R_ y due to the moments _M_ C and _M_ L are evaluated using the factors from Figure 60. Logarithmic interpolation is used for all parameters in these figures. If any of the parameters is outside the range of the figures a warning message is produced.
For solid attachments the deflection _D_ z due to the radial load _P_ is evaluated using factors derived from Tables 1 and 2 in [\[22\]](<h9998.htm#0022>). A correction factor is applied to compensate for values of the ratio _L_ / _R m_ other than 8.0.
The rotations _R_ x and _R_ y due to the moments _M_ C and _M_ L are evaluated using factors from Figures 3 and 7 in [\[23\]](<h9998.htm#0023>). For the rotation _R_ x a correction factor is applied to compensate for values of the ratio _L_ / _R m_ other than 4.0.
If the value of β exceeds 0.25 \(the limit for the deflection data\) a warning message is produced.
For a nozzle or attachment with a reinforcing pad or insert plate, the deflections and rotations are calculated at the edge of the reinforcing pad or insert plate using the method for solid attachments.
## Pipe and Shell Flexibility
When considering the loadings on nozzles due to attached piping it is possible for the program to calculate a reduced radial load and reduced moments using a linear interpolation of the shell and pipe spring characteristics. To use this facility data must be entered for the free end rotations _R_ x and _R_ y and the free end deflection _D_ z.
For details of this facility please refer to [Pipe and Shell Flexibility](<h9997.htm#0900>).
The signs of the free end deflection and rotations must be the same as those of the corresponding load and moments.
## General Limitations
### WRC 107/537
WRC 107/537 contains two limitations which are checked by the program. The results are not considered applicable if the ratio _L_ / _R m_ is less than 1.0 - see WRC 107/537 subsection 4.5.1, last paragraph; or if the attachment is located less than _R m_ / 2 from the end of the shell - see WRC 107/537 subsection 4.5.2.
### WRC 297
Various limitations are specified in WRC 297 subsection 3.2, and these are checked by the program. If the ratio _d_ / _t_ is less than 20 or _D_ / _T_ is less than 20 or _d_ / _T_ is less than 5, then the thin shell theory used is not considered to be valid. However, if the nozzle thickness is large it acts as a nearly rigid insert, so reasonable results for the stresses in the shell are obtained for any value of _d_ / _t_. The figures in WRC 297 include _d_ /_t_ = 10, which for the calculation of the stresses in the shell gives a reasonable approximation for any smaller value of _d_ / _t_ \- see WRC 297 subsection 3.2, first and third paragraphs.
If the ratio _d_ / _D_ is greater than 0.5 the shallow shell solutions used in the method may not be valid. Because the theory does not necessarily account for non-linear effects or buckling, the ratio _D_ / _T_ should not exceed 2500. The theory is applicable to isolated nozzles, and if the clearance from the edge of a nozzle to the end of the shell, or any other discontinuity, is less than _2.√\(D.T\)_ then the theory may not be applicable.
WRC 297 Appendix A-5 recommends that for nozzles with reinforcing pads, or butt welded insert nozzles, the stresses in the shell may be calculated using the combined shell plus pad thickness or insert plate thickness, as appropriate, provided that the width of the reinforcing pad or insert plate is not less than _1.65√\(R.T\)_ where _T_ is the shell plus pad thickness or insert plate thickness. If the pad width is less than this limit WRC 297 recommends that no credit should be taken for the extra thickness in the calculations. As this program performs double calculations; though the combined pad/shell thickness as well as at the edge of the pad this recommendation is ignored.
WRC 297 is not applicable to nozzles that protrude inside the vessel, and the nozzle must be attached by a full penetration weld - see WRC 297 subsection 3.2, last paragraph.
### STP-PT-074
The rules in STP-PT-074 are only applicable when the limitations in section 4.5.15.3 are met, and these are checked by the program.
If _\(dm/Dm\).sqr\(Dm/T\)_ is greater than 10, collapse due to external loads and pressure should be evaluated per ASME VIII Div.2 section 5.4.
STP-PT-074 is not applicable to nozzles that protrude inside the vessel, and the nozzle must be attached by a full penetration weld.

# System Messages
## Warning and Advisory Messages
Messages printed below in _italics_ are not considered to be critical - see [Warnings Messages](<h9997.htm#0501>).
_Acceptable calculation_ | The calculations have been performed successfully and the calculated stresses are less than the corresponding allowable stresses.  
---|---  
Beta out of range | One or more of the values of factor β is outside the range of one or more of the specific curves in WRC 107/537 Fig. 1A to Fig. 4C. The value of the relevant dimensionless membrane force or moment at the limit value of β is used.  
Clearance to shell end | The attachment is located less than _R m_ / 2 from the end of the shell - see WRC 107/537 subsection 4.5.2, or the clearance from the edge of a nozzle to the end of the shell is less than 2.Sqrt\(D.T\) - see WRC 297 subsection 3.2. The theory may not be applicable. When using the STP-PT-074 method one or more of the limits for the attachment location in section 4.5.15.8 have been exceeded. When the distance from the end of the vessel is less than \(0.4Dm^1.4.T^-0.4\) then local stiffening and lowering of the stresses in the nozzle connection may occur, or if it is less than sqr\(RT\) a local discontinuity can exist and stresses may increase. The magnitude of these effects can be investigated using ASME VIII Div.2 Part 5.  
Code limitations exceeded |  One or more of the following limitations has not been met: 
* The limitations specified in ASME VIII Div.2 for the component have been exceeded. Use of the _Shells - Internal Pressure_ module will give detailed warning messages. 
* When using STP-PT-074 the limit specified in 4.5.15.3 Equation \(4.5.195\) is out of range, the user should refer to ASME VIII Div.2 section 5.4 to evaluate collapse due to external loads and pressure.   
_d/t out of range_ | The ratio _d_ / _t_ is less than 10.0 or greater than 100.0 - see WRC 297 Fig. 3 to Fig. 58. The stress resultants at the limit value are used - see WRC 297.  
_Deflection out of range_ | For a solid attachment or a nozzle or attachment with a reinforcing pad or insert plate, the value of β exceeds 0.25 \(the limit for the deflection data\). For a nozzle without a pad, one of the parameters is outside the range of WRC 297 Figure 59 or Figure 60. The deflection calculation produced may be unreliable.  
Diameter limit exceeded | The shell, cone or head outside diameter exceeds the limit in TABLE UW-12 for the specified weld type.  
Full radiography reqd | The shell, cone or head thickness exceeds 1.5" and full radiography has not been specified - see UW-11\(a\)\(2\).  
Gamma out of range | Factor γ is outside the range of one or more of the specific curves - see WRC 107/537 Fig. 1A to Fig. 4C. The dimensionless membrane forces and bending moments at the limit value are used.  
Lambda out of range | Factor λ is less than 0.01 or greater than 10.0 - see WRC 297 Fig. 3 to Fig. 58. The stress resultants at the limit value are used.  
_Low temperature_ | Further analysis per 4.1.5 may be required - see [Limitations](<h9996.htm#0700>).  
_Max pressure_ | The pressure limit has been exceeded - see 1.2.2.2.  
Nozzle configuration | WRC 297 and STP-PT-074 are not applicable to nozzles that protrude through the shell or are not attached by full penetration welds.  
Nozzle strength ratio | The membrane stress in the nozzle neck due to pressure and external loads exceeds the allowable design stress.  
_Pad OD_ | The pad width is less than the PD 5500 recommended minimum for pressure considerations. Further checks may be necessary.  
Pad thk | The pad thickness is greater than _1.5 T_ as specified in STP-PT-074 section 4.5.15.3 Equation \(4.5.193\).  
Pad width | The pad width is less than the limit specified in STP-PT-074 section 4.5.15.3 Equation \(4.5.194\).  
_Radial_ | For local load calculations the nozzle is considered to be Radial.  
Ratio d/D | The ratio _d_ / _D_ is greater than 0.5. The shallow shell solutions used in the method may not be valid - see WRC 297 subsection 3.2.  
Ratio d/T | The ratio _d_ / _T_ is less than 5.0. The thin shell theory used is not considered to be valid - see WRC 297 subsection 3.2.  
_Ratio D/T_ | The ratio _D_ / _T_ is less than 20.0, so the thin shell theory used is not considered to be valid, or _D_ / _T_ is greater than 2500 and the theory does not necessarily account for non-linear effects or buckling - see WRC 297 subsection 3.2.  
_Ratio d/t_ | The ratio _d_ / _t_ is less than 20.0. The thin shell theory used is not considered to be valid. However, for large nozzle thicknesses reasonable results for the stresses in the shell are obtained for any value of _d_ / _t_ \- see WRC 297 subsection 3.2, first and third paragraphs.  
Ratio dp/Dm | The ratio _dp_ / _Dm_ is greater than 0.7. So the acceptability of external loads must be determined by the rules in ASME VIII Div.2 Part 5.  
Shell length  | The ratio _L_ / _R m_ is less than 1.0 - see WRC 107/537 subsection 4.5.1, final paragraph.  
Stress limit exceeded | One or more of the calculated stresses exceeds the corresponding allowable stress.  
_T/t out of range_ | The ratio _T_ / _t_ is greater than 10.0 - see WRC 297 Fig. 3 to Fig. 58. The stress resultants at the limit value are used.  
_Table values out of range_ | The ratios β1 / β2 or β2 / β1 are less than 0.25 or greater than 4.0. The value of the factors at the limit values of the ratios are used.  
Thickness limit exceeded | The shell, cone or head thickness exceeds the limit in TABLE UW-12 for the specified weld type.  
WRC 107 graphs  | The dimensionless membrane forces and/or bending moments have been obtained from the dotted part of the curves, or by extrapolation in WRC 107 Fig. 1A to Fig. 4C.  
WRC 297 graphs  | The stress resultants have been obtained by extrapolation of WRC 297 Fig. 3 to Fig. 58.  
WRC 537 graphs  | The dimensionless membrane forces and/or bending moments have been obtained from the dotted part of the curves in WRC 537 Fig. 1A to Fig. 4C\(Original\).
