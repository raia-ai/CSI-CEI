# Flange data
## Data Input
Description | Enter the flange description.  
---|---  
Connection | Select the type of flange to shell connection - see [Flange to Shell Connections](<h9992.htm>).  
ASME Rated flange calc | Select _No_ to use the methodology in Appendix 2/Section 4.16, or _Yes_ to evaluate a rated flange to ASME. **NOTE: If this option is set to _Yes_ a Rated flange must be selected from the folowing menu.**  
Standard flange data | Import [Standard Flange Data](<h9982.htm>), if ASME Rated flange is set to _Yes_ , this is the Rated Flange selection.  
Reverse flange | Select _Reversed_ for a reverse flange or _Normal_ for a normal flange - see [Flange to Shell Connections](<h9992.htm>).  
With taper hub | Select _Yes_ for a flange with a hub or _No_ for a flange with no hub - see [Flange to Shell Connections](<h9992.htm>).  
Hub slope | Select _1 : 3 max_ or _1 : 1 max_ for the required maximum hub slope.  
Facing | Select the required flange facing type - see [Facing & Gasket Data](<h9985.htm>)  
Facing configuration | Select the required facing configuration as _Raised_ , _Flat_ or _Recessed_. NOTE: Not all facing configurations are available for each facing type.  
Flange Material | Flange material selection from the [Material Database](<h9996.htm>).  
Lap data | Heading to denote the following data applies to the lap.  
With taper hub | Select _Yes_ for a lap with a hub or _No_ for a lap with no hub.  
Lap Material | Lap material selection from the [Material Database](<h9996.htm>).  
Internally confined gasket | Check this box to specify an internally confined gasket.  
Bolt hole dia | Enter the diameter of the bolt hole in the flange.  
Quantity | Enter the quantity of bolts.  
## Additional Information
Unless a flange has a gasket and another component attached to it, then the software will not produce a calculation for that particular flange.
For flange types [Fillet welded: Stepped](<h9992.htm#0200>) and [Fillet welded: Smooth](<h9992.htm#0300>) the shell material is the same as the adjacent shell or nozzle.
## Warning Messages
NOTE: In many cases a satisfactory clearance may be achieved by modifying the dimension of the part of the flange causing the clearance problem, such as the flange outside diameter or hub diameter, instead of changing the bolt circle diameter.
Bolt PCD - Hub/Edge clearance | The bolt circle diameter is too large or too small for the recommended clearances - see [Bolting Data](<h9984.htm>).  
---|---  
Bolt PCD - Gasket diameter | The gasket diameter conflicts with the bolt circle diameter - see [Facing & Gasket Data](<h9985.htm>).  
Bolt PCD - Bolt spacing | The Bolt PCD is too small to fit the number of bolts specified, based on the minimum spacing for that bolt - see [Bolting Data](<h9984.htm>).  
## Error Messages
See also [General component error messages](<h9100.htm#1000>).
Confining/facing height | The Facing has been defined as an _Internally confined gasket_ but no _confining height_ has been input, or no _facing height_ has been input  
---|---  
Conflicting diameters | One or more of the flange dimensions doesn't match the attached shell/nozzle or is invalid.  
Conflicting facings | One or more of the facing dimensions doesn't match the other or is invalid, alternatively the facing configurations are incompatible - see [Facing & Gasket Data](<h9985.htm>).  
Diameter | One or more of the flange diameters is incorrect or the _Flange ID_ clashes with the _Shell OD_ or for a reverse flange the _Flange OD_ clashes with the _Shell ID_.  
Flange dimensions | The Flange diameter and/or thickness is invalid.  
Flange Length < Thk + Hub | The distance between the Flange face and the adjacent Circumferential weld is less than the flange thickness plus any hub length input.  
Flange thk | The input facing height is greater than or equal to the flange thickness.  
Height | The Facing has been defined as either _Raised_ or _Recessed_ but no _facing height_ has been input.  
Hub dimensions | The _Large end hub diameter_ is less than the _Small end hub diameter_ or the _Hub length_ is zero. Also the hub slope is greater than the maximum specified.  
Radius | An invalid corner radius has been specified.  
Weld | For _Fillet welded: stepped_ or _Fillet welded: smooth_ the weld dimension input is invalid - see [Flange to Shell Connections](<h9992.htm>).
