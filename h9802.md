# User Administration
The system has the capacity for 256 users, each with a unique login ID and password.
## System Administrator
The System Administrator \(user 000\) may add, edit and delete other users. 
When logged in as the System Administrator, the screen will be displayed as shown below.
![](..\\img\\usrAdmin2.png)
The first column shows the user number, the user currently logged on to this machine is marked with ![](..\\img\\user1.png), other users currently logged on to the system are marked with ![](..\\img\\user2.png). The second column shows the unique user ID.
Clicking on one of these entries will enable the edit boxes at the bottom of the screen.
Only the System Administrator can edit the _Unique ID_ which must be two or three characters in length. This unique identifier will be marked on each and every calculation performed by this user.
The _Password_ must be four characters long.
To add a new user to the list, highlight _New entry_ in the user list on the left of the screen, then input the _Unique ID_ and _Password_ , then click the _Save_ button.
If a computer is shut down while the software is still running, it may leave an item file "locked". Other users will see the message _File engaged by user X_ and will be unable to access the file. The System Administrator can clear these locks by highlighting the user on the left hand side of the screen and clicking on the _Clear locks_ button.
To delete a user, select the entry to be deleted and press the _Delete User/_ button.
## Other users
Other ordinary users may only change their own password.
When logged in as an ordinary user, the screen will be displayed as shown below

Highlight the _Unique ID_ and enter a new password in the edit box at the bottom of the screen.

![](..\\img\\envdata.png)
**Company Name** | If this is a new installation the Company Name will be set to "Your Company Name" and can be edited from this screen.  
---|---  
**Environment Pathname** | Path to the folders containing the users' password files and login session files. NB: This pathname must exist to continue.  
**Local Pathname** | Path to a local folder for storing temporary files. It is recommended that this folder be located on the C: drive to avoid performance problems. NB: If this pathname doesn't exist then the user will be prompted to create this directory.  
**Serial number** | If Finglow has already been installed this will be the original Serial number for the account, if this is a brand new installation then it will be a system generated unique number for the installation and cannot be changed.  
NOTE: Any changes made to this data will not take effect until the next Log On.
