# Finglow Software Overview
## How the application works
Finglow Pressure Vessel Software consists of a fully integrated suite of [Engineering Modules](<h8001.htm#0000>) allowing the user to perform design calculations for pressure vessels and heat exchangers on a modular basis. Data can be entered using either the Finglow 2D or Finglow 3D programs - see below.
