# ASME VIII Div.2 - Bolted Flanged Connections
* * *
# Program Capabilities
This program performs the calculations for circular bolted flanges subject to internal or external pressure, in accordance with ASME VIII Div.2 Section 4.16. The gasket contact face must be entirely within the circle enclosed by the bolts, except for reverse flanges where the gasket may alternatively be entirely outside the bolt circle.
The option to perform Rated Flange calculations is also available for B16.5 and B16.47 flanges. I addition the program can also perform MDMT calculations as per UCS-66.
NOTE: The program does not cover flat face flanges with metal-to-metal contact outside the bolt circle.
Flanges may be with or without hubs, and may be butt welded, fillet welded or lap jointed. Fillet welded flanges without hubs may be designed as integral or loose. Fillet weld sizes are checked to Section 4.2.
In addition to pressure loading the program can also take account of the effects of an applied axial force and a bending moment if required.
Bolting data for standard metric and inch series bolts is provided by the program. Physical clearances of the edge and hub are checked. Applied bolt loads for the gasket seating and operating conditions may be specified if required. A bolt spacing correction factor may also be applied, if needed, in accordance with Table 4.16.11.
The requirements of TEMA Section 5 RCB-11.7 [\[26\]](<h9998.htm#0026>) for [Gaskets with Pass partition ribs](<h9985.htm#1000>) can be considered, if required. 
In addition to checking the design of a flange with specified dimensions, the program also has the facility to optimise any of the following: the bolting, the gasket location, the hub length, the hub large end diameter and the flange thickness.
When the calculations have been performed the flange may be drawn on the screen to facilitate the checking of clearances and proportions. The program also calculates the approximate weight of the flange.
All thicknesses are entered in the new or as built condition. Both internal and external corrosion allowances may be specified as required - see Corrosion.
The shell to which the flange is fitted may be specified by either inside or outside diameter. A thinning allowance may be specified either as a percentage of the new thickness or as an absolute value in mm or inches. The thinning allowance is always applied to the inside surface.

# Operation
## Flange Types
There are two basic flange types covered by the program as shown in [Flange to Shell Connections](<h9992.htm>).
Normal flanges where the bolt circle diameter is outside the shell - see Figures 4.16.1 to 4.16.6
Reverse flanges where the bolt circle diameter is inside the shell - see Figures 4.16.7. NOTE: The program permits the bolts to be located either inside or outside the gasket.
Flanges may be specified with or without a hub at the back of the flange, except for reverse fillet welded types which must be without a hub.
## Joint Efficiency
For the purposes of assessing the stresses, no account is taken of joint efficiencies Any variation of joint jfficiency should be entered by adjusting the value of allowable stress.
## Gaskets & Facings
See [Gaskets & Facings](<h0598.htm#0500>). 
## Bolting
See [Bolting](<h0598.htm#0600>) and [Bolting Data](<h9984.htm>). 
## Corrosion
Both internal and external corrosion allowances may be specified as required. The corrosion allowances are applied to the internal and external surfaces of the flange and the shell as shown in [Flange to Shell Connections](<h9992.htm>).
## Applied Force and Bending Moment
In addition to pressure loading the program can also take account of the effects of an axial force _F_ A and a bending moment _M_ E acting in a plane through the axis of the shell or nozzle to which the flange is attached. Typically these loadings may be due to wind and dead weight loadings on vessels or piping loads on nozzles. Compressive forces are to be neglected and for that case _F_ A should be taken as equal to zero.
## Calculations
### Integral and Loose Designs
Integral flanges are those where the flange and shell \(or nozzle neck\) are considered to be the equivalent of an integral structure. For fillet welded flanges the shell is considered to act as a hub, and in order for this to be valid there are restrictions on the minimum fillet weld sizes specified in Table 4.2.9. These are checked by the program.
Loose flanges are those where the flange has no direct connection with the shell \(lap joint\), or where the method of attachment is not considered to give the mechanical strength equivalent to that of an integral attachment.
NOTE: The program will determine whether the flange is classed as loose or integral, as defined in Figures 4.16.1 to 4.16.7, from the flange to shell connection selected. For fillet welded flanges without hubs the user may specify whether to design the flange as integral or loose. The dimensions of welds in optional flanges are neither input nor checked. 
![](..\\img\\integvloose.png)
### Bolt Loads
Bolt loads _W_ o and _W_ g are calculated for the operating and gasket seating \(bolting-up\) conditions respectively, in accordance with 4.16.6.1 \(d\) and \(e\).
NOTE 1: When a _Self-energising_ gasket is specified the minimum required bolt load for gasket seating _W_ gs is taken as 0.0 except where a significant axial force is required to compress the gasket - see 4.16.6 \(e\) STEP 5.
NOTE 2: For _Lap joint_ flanges the diameter _G_ is taken as the mean diameter of the contact face between the loose backing flange and the lap - see Figure 4.16.6.
The applied bolt loads for the operating and bolting-up conditions, when specified by the user, are checked against the calculated loads and the higher values are used to evaluate the required bolt cross-section area _A_ m. The total required bolt cross-section area _A_ m is checked against the actual cross-section area of the bolts _A_ b.
### Flange Moments
Moments are calculated for the operating and bolting-up conditions in accordance with 4.16.7 \(f\) STEP 6.
SIGN CONVENTION: The sign convention used in the program is as follows: 
  * Positive loads are those which produce tension in the bolts.  
  * Moment arms are positive measured from the bolt circle diameter inwards towards the centre-line of the shell.
Moments are calculated about the bolt circle diameter _C_ in accordance with Table 4.16.6
NOTE: For the compressive load case, if the moment arms \(_h_ D \- _h_ G\) and \(_h_ T \- _h_ G\) are of opposite sign, the moment is taken as the larger of _H_ D\(_h_ D -_h_ G\) or _H_ T\(_h_ T \- _h_ G\).
### Flange Factors
The flange factors _T_ , _U_ , _Y_ and _Z_ are evaluated using the equations given on Table 4.16.4. The integral flange factors _F_ and _V_ , the loose hub factors _F_ L and _V_ L, and the hub stress correction factor _f_ are evaluated using the equations given in Table 4.16.5
NOTE: For large values of _h_ / _h_ o and _g_ 1 / _g_ o the equations in Table 4.16.5 become discontinuous, and unreliable values of the various factors may be evaluated. A warning message Ratio _g_ 1 / _g_ o will be given if this occurs.
## Flange Stresses
The longitudinal hub stress _S_ H, radial flange stress _S_ R and tangential flange stress _S_ T as appropriate are calculated for the operating and bolting-up conditions in accordance with Table 4.16.8. The average stress is calculated as the greater of 1/2\(_S_ H \+ _S_ R\) or 1/2\(_S_ H \+ _S_ T\).
### Lap Joints
For lap joint flanges the stresses in the loose backing flange are calculated as indicated in the paragraphs above. In addition the shear stress in the lap and the bearing stress at the contact face between the flange and the lap are also calculated for the operating and bolting-up conditions.
NOTE: If the gasket width does not straddle the mean diameter of the contact face between the lap and the loose backing flange the lap will be subject to bending stresses which are not analysed by the program. A warning message will be produced if this occurs.
## Allowable Flange Design Stresses
For the operating and bolting-up conditions the allowable flange design stresses are determined in accordance with Table 4.16.9 and are based on the specified allowable stresses at the design temperature and at atmospheric temperature respectively.
## Design Optimisation
In addition to checking a flange with specified dimensions, the program also has the facility to optimise certain parameters - see [Design optimisation](<h9997.htm#0390>). 
## Flange Pairs
For the design of pairs of flanges it is sometimes necessary to perform the calculations separately for each flange. This situation occurs with the flanges used either side of a heat exchanger tubesheet, where the design conditions and/or gaskets are not the same; and with flanges having different inside diameters, such as those used to connect the shell cover to the shell on a floating head exchanger.
The program incorporates the following features to enable these calculations to be performed correctly:
Dependent on the [Bolt tightening method](<h9997.htm#0400>) selected, pre determined bolt loads can be applied.
If the design bolt load is determined from a mating flange, these bolt loads can used - see [Loads across Tubesheets](<h9997.htm#0410>)
The mating flange inside diameter is specified by the user so that the gasket seating width is correctly calculated for flanges with different diameters.
## Rigidity Index
The program will calculate the rigidity index _J_ in accordance with Table 4.16.10 where _M o_ and _M g_ are calculated with the bolt spacing correction factor _B SC_ = 1. A warning will be given if the calculated rigidity index _J_ is greater than 1.0. For lap jointed flanges the rigidity check is performed for the main flange only.
