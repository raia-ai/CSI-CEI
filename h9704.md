# EFP Linker
The purpose of linking files is to create a template Input File, which can consist of more than one data sheet. For example, a complex Screen File could be split into two Screen Files. Using the Link EFP sheets option, the two Screen Files can be linked together, with, for example, just one Equation File.
After creating a Screen File and possibly an Equation File and Function File if they were needed using the [EFP Editor](<h9703.htm>) option ,the next step is to link those files together to form an Input File. After selecting this option the following screen will then be displayed,

From this Screen, Equation and Function files can be selected for linking by double clicking on the required file in the three list boxes. When a file has been selected its name is transferred into the lower list box under the appropriate heading.
This procedure can be repeated, depending on the number of sheets to be linked together. For Calculation sheets each Screen file must be linked to an Equation file. The maximum number of sets of files which can be linked is 12.
After completing the selections press the **OK** button to save the _Link file template_ using the standard [Save Input](<h9801.htm#0200>).
