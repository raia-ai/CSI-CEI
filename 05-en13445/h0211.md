# EN 13445 - Floating Head Covers & Rings
* * *
# Program Capabilities
This program performs the calculations for spherically domed and bolted ends of the form shown in Figure 12-1, subject to internal and external pressure, in accordance with EN 13445 Clause 12. Flanges may be narrow-faced or full-faced, the bolting area required, the bolt loads and the gasket width check are calculated in accordance with Clause 11.5.2. For narrow-faced flanges the gasket contact face must be entirely within the circle enclosed by the bolts.
NOTE: The program does not cover full-faced flanges with metal-to-metal contact outside the bolt circle.
Backing rings may also be specified. They can be specified as one of two types, a normal backing ring which can be solid or have single or double splits, or a keyed type backing ring which can be solid or have a single split. The outside diameter of the backing ring is taken as the flange outside diameter.
NOTE: The keyed type backing ring can not be specified in conjunction with a full-faced flange.
Bolting data for standard metric and inch series bolts is provided by the program. Recommended minimum clearances are based on TEMA TABLE D-5 -see [\[26\]](<h9998.htm#0026>).
Dependent on the [Bolt tightening method](<h9997.htm#0400>) selected, pre determined bolt loads can be applied.
All thicknesses are entered in the new or as built condition, except as noted - see Backing Ring Flange Types. Both tubeside and shellside corrosion allowances may be specified as required - see Corrosion.
The cover to which the flange is fitted is specified by the inside spherical radius. A thinning allowance may be specified either as a percentage of the new thickness or as an absolute value in mm or inches. The thinning allowance is always applied to the inside surface.
* * *
# Operation
## Spherically Domed and Bolted End
This type of domed and bolted end is designed by treating the domed end and the bolted flange as two separate components in compliance with the relevant clauses in 12.4. The flange is attached to the cover by a full penetration weld, all components are considered to be seamless. Corrosion is deducted from the flange and the cover as indicated in the diagram below. NOTE: The maximum of the shellside and tubeside corrosion allowance will be deducted from the bore irrespective of the location of the cover.

## Backing Ring Flange Types
Corrosion allowances are not deducted from backing ring flanges as these components are generally considered disposable, hence corroded dimensions should be entered if a corrosion allowance is required.
### Normal Backing Ring
This type of backing ring can be specified as a solid ring, a single split ring or two split rings. The inside diameter can not be greater than the tubesheet outside diameter.
### Keyed Backing Ring
This type of backing ring can be specified as having a single split, or being solid.
![](..\\img\\keyedbr.png)
NB: The software does not check the thickness at the base of the groove in the tubesheet. This should be greater than the value _t 1._
## Gaskets & Facings
See [Gaskets & Facings](<h0298.htm#0550>).
## Bolting
See [Bolting](<h0298.htm#0600>) and [Bolting Data](<h9984.htm>).
## Corrosion
Both tubeside and shellside corrosion allowances may be specified as required. The corrosion allowances are applied to the tubeside and shellside surfaces of the flange, cover and tubesheet as shown in Spherically Domed and Bolted End and Keyed Backing Ring. Corrosion allowance is not deducted from the gasket seating face of the flange or backing ring.
## Test conditions
See [Test Pressures](<h0298.htm#0300>) for the calculation of the allowable stresses and loads in the test conditions.
NOTE: The test pressure condition considers only the flange material. The bolting or dished cover may govern the test case and should be considered separately.
## Calculations
### Bolt Loads
Bolt loads _W_ op and _W_ A are calculated for the operating and bolting-up conditions respectively, in accordance with Clause 11.5.2.
### Flange Moments
Moments are calculated for the operating and bolting-up conditions generally in accordance with Clause 12.5 or 12.6 as appropriate. For flanges with backing rings separate moment calculations are performed for the backing ring.
### Flange Factors
The flange factor _β_ Y is evaluated using equation \(11.5-25\).
### Backing Ring Stresses
The stresses in the backing ring are only calculated for a keyed type backing ring. The tangential flange stress _S_ T is calculated for the operating and bolting-up conditions. The longitudinal hub stress _S_ H and the radial flange stress _S_ R are taken as zero. In addition the bearing stress and the shear stress are also calculated for the operating and bolting-up conditions. The bearing stress is at the contact face between the backing ring and the tubesheet, the shear stress is at the ring inside diameter through the small end thk _t_ 1.
### Allowable Backing Ring Design Stresses
For the operating and bolting-up conditions the allowable backing ring design stresses are determined and are based on the specified design strengths at the design temperature and at atmospheric temperature respectively.

_Bolt circle : min_ | The bolt circle diameter is too small to comply with the recommended bolt clearances. The value displayed shows the recommended minimum.  
Bolt stress | The bolt stress limit has been exceeded.  
_Bolt tensioning recommended_ | The nominal bolt diameter exceeds 38 mm - see PD 5500 3.8.1.4, or the _Probable wrench load_ predicted by ASME VIII, Div.1 Nonmandatory Appendix S is less than the actual bolt load. The use of bolt tensioning or torque tightening equipment is recommended.  
_Bolt tightening controlled_ | The bolt stress has exceeded the nominal code limit but may be acceptable for controlled bolt tightening if agreed between the designer, manufacturer and inspection authority. See also, ASME VIII, Div.1 Nonmandatory Appendix S.  
_Contact width N\(min\)_ | The gasket contact width _N_ is less than the minimum from Annex H.  
EN 13445-5 Table 6.6.1-1 | One or more of the parameters in the table _Testing groups for steel pressure vessels_ is outside the limits.  
Extrapolated graphs/tables | Factor K is greater than 5.0.  
Flange thk | The flange thickness is less than the minimum required, determined in accordance with Clause 12.5 or 12.6.  
Insufficient bolting  | The total required bolt cross-sectional area _A_ m is greater than the actual cross-sectional area _A_ b.  
Insufficient cover thk | The cover is too thin for the specified internal or external pressure, determined in accordance with Clause 12.5 or 12.6.  
_Insufficient pre-load_ | The specified bolt pre-load input is less than the design load required.  
Insufficient thk | The backing ring thickness is less than the minimum specified.  
_Low temperature_ | Further analysis per EN 13445-2 Annex B may be required - see [Limitations](<h9996.htm#0700>).  
_Min bolt dia_ | The nominal bolt diameter is less than the recommended minimum of 12mm.  
Shop test condition  | Further calculations are required for the shop test condition. NOTE: Although no output is produced for the test condition, the items of output which need investigation will be listed.  
Site test condition  | Further calculations are required for the site test condition. NOTE: Although no output is produced for the test condition, the items of output which need investigation will be listed.  
Stress limit exceeded  | One or more of the calculated stresses exceeds the corresponding allowable stress.  
Unsuitable for external pressure  | The cover thickness is less than that required in Clause 12.5.2 or 12.6.2, for a spherical shell of radius _R_ 1 under external pressure.  
## Fatal Warning Messages
See [Fatal Messages](<h9997.htm#0502>).
Design temp | The minimum design temperature is 20° C - see Clause 5.3.7.  
---|---  
DT stress > ATM stress  | Material properties at the design temperature exceed those at room temperature.  
Facing configuration | An invalid combination of facing and mating facing configurations has been entered.  
Gasket | The Gasket Material and Gasket Type combination is invalid - see [Gasket types](<h9985.htm#0300>).  
Gasket/Calc method | The gasket selection is incompatible with the calculation method.  
Input  | An item of input has not been entered or is outside of the expected range: 
* For keyed backing ring flanges, the _Slope of taper_ has been entered as 80° or more. 
* For keyed backing ring flanges the groove depth is greater than the ring thickness. 
* For full faced flanges, the clearance between the bolt and the bolt hole is geometrically incorrect.  
Invalid data | A combination of input data is invalid or inconsistent, e.g. 
* For full-faced flange the gasket width does not straddle the bolt circle diameter C. 
* The flange outside diameter is less than or equal to the flange inside diameter. 
* For the external pressure calculation Factor K is less than zero in Figure 3.6-4. 
* The offset from centre of the cover to the centroid of the flange has been input so that the cover is not on the flange. 
* The facing/gasket dimensions are incompatible.  
| For keyed backing rings: 
* The diameter to the groove is greater than or equal to the ring outside diameter. 
* The diameter to the groove is less than or equal to the tubesheet outside diameter. 
* The diameter to the groove is less than or equal to the ring inside diameter.   
Material | There has been an error getting data from the [Material Database](<h9996.htm>), a more detailed explanation of this error will displayed on the Material Dialog box of the specific material.  
Method failure | Component dimensions are such that the calculation method has failed - see also [Fatal Messages](<h9997.htm#0502>).  
Thickness  | A new or as built thickness is less than the sum of corrosion/tolerance allowances.  
Tolerance  | The thickness tolerance is greater than the new or as built thickness.
