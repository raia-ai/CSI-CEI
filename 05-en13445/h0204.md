# EN 13445 - Saddle & Ring Supports
* * *
# Program Capabilities
This program performs the calculations for the stresses in cylindrical horizontal vessels supported on two symmetrically located saddles only in accordance with EN 13445 Clause 16.8 and the stresses in cylindrical horizontal vessels supported on two symmetrically located rings only in accordance with Clause 16.9. NOTE: For vessels supported on rings the horizontal force _F H_ is assumed to be zero.
The program calculates the internal volume of the shell and heads in the uncorroded condition, and hence the weight of the liquid contents for a specified liquid level and specific gravity. 
* * *
# Operation
## Support Types
The following types of support are covered by the program:
[Plain saddle](<h9988.htm#0010>).  
[Internal ring](<h9988.htm#0020>).  
[External ring](<h9988.htm#0020>).  
[Ring support](<h9988.htm#0040>). 
Saddle angles from 60° to 180° are permitted by the program, except when a stiffening ring is fitted then the minimum angle is 30°.
## Cylindrical Shell
The maximum permitted internal pressure is calculated and checked per Clause 7.4.2
## Dished Heads
### Ellipsoidal Heads
The maximum permitted internal pressure is calculated and checked per Clause 7.5.4
### Hemispherical Heads
The maximum permitted internal pressure is calculated and checked per Clause 7.5.2
### Torispherical Heads
The maximum permitted internal pressure is calculated and checked per Clause 7.5.3
## Extended Wrapper Plates
If the calculated circumferential stresses in the shell are too high, then they can be reduced by fitting a wrapper plate or wear plate. The size of the wrapper that may be considered in the calculation is output.
If a wrapper plate is specified then the minimum required wrapper angle and width will be checked. If either the angle or the width is insufficient the wrapper will be ignored. If both the wrapper angle and width are sufficient then the relevant stresses are calculated in the wrapper at the edge of the saddle, using the combined shell and wrapper thickness, and also in the shell at the edge of the wrapper. The wrapper material is assumed to be the same as the shell.
## Stiffening Rings
Additional stiffening of the shell may be provided by means of stiffening rings which may be positioned either externally or internally. The [Specification of Stiffening Rings](<h9990.htm>) is the same as that for the _Shells - External Pressure_ module. The relevant corrosion allowance is deducted from all surfaces of stiffeners.
NOTE: Wrapper plates, as detailed in Extended Wrapper Plates, are not considered to form part of any attached stiffening ring.
## Ring Type Supports
[Ring Support](<h9988.htm#0040>) are used where it is important to ensure that the shell close to the supports remains round. This applies particularly to thin walled vessels which may distort excessively due to the weight of the vessel and contents, and to vessels subject to vacuum.
## Calculated and Allowable Loads
### Longitudinal Loads
The longitudinal loads/stresses are calculated at mid-span between the supports and at the supports. The longitudinal loads/stresses are calculated with no pressure, internal and/or external pressure.
### Circumferential Loads
For ring supports and plain saddles, circumferential loads are calculated the edge of the support and at the edge of the wrapper \(when fitted\).
