# EN 13445 - Bolted or Welded Flat Heads
* * *
# Program Capabilities
This program performs calculations for unstayed circular flat heads and covers subject to internal pressure, in accordance with EN 13445-3 Section 10. If required, the calculations for the reinforcement of a single nozzle or opening in the flat head are performed in accordance with 10.6.
Flat heads or covers may be bolted, integrally forged, butt welded or fillet welded to the shell. The various types of flat head are specified from [Welded: Type 1](<h9991.htm#0001>) to [Welded: Type 3](<h9991.htm#0003>) and [Bolted: Type 1](<h9991.htm#0011>) to [Bolted: Type 2](<h9991.htm#0012>).
NOTE: The program does not include rectangular, elliptical or obround flat heads.
Bolting data for standard metric and inch series bolts is provided by the program. Clearances are based on TEMA TABLE D-5 - see [\[26\]](<h9998.htm#0026>). 
The deflection of bolted covers may also be checked, if necessary, in accordance with TEMA clause RCB-9.2.1. 
Dependent on the [Bolt tightening method](<h9997.htm#0400>) selected, pre determined bolt loads can be applied. 
For bolted covers, the requirements of TEMA Section 5 RCB-11.7 [\[26\]](<h9998.htm#0026>) for [pass partition plates](<h9985.htm#1000>) can be considered, if required.

# Operation 
## Welded Flat Heads
Flat head types [Welded: Type 1](<h9991.htm#0001>) to [Welded: Type 5](<h9991.htm#0005>) are described in the following subsections. The corresponding identification letters from Figure 10.4 are shown. Weld details may be varied to suit the actual cover type shown in Annex A.
The required thickness _e_ of welded flat heads is calculated in accordance with Clause 10.4.5. For flat heads [Welded: Type 1](<h9991.htm#0001>),[Welded: Type 6](<h9991.htm#0006>),[Welded: Type 9](<h9991.htm#0009>),[Welded: Type 10](<h9991.htm#0010>) and [Welded: Type 11](<h9991.htm#0011>) the required cover thickness is calculated in accordance with Clause 10.4.4.
The various limitations specified in Clause 10.4.2 for each head type are checked by the program.
### Integral Or Butt Welded
[Welded: Type 2](<h9991.htm#0002>) and [Welded: Type 3](<h9991.htm#0003>) are typically forged integral with the shell, or butt welded to the shell. These head types have an inside corner radius, and type [Welded: Type 3](<h9991.htm#0003>) has a straight flange section tapering down to the shell thickness.
### Fillet Welded To Inside Of Shell
[Welded: Type 1](<h9991.htm#0001>) and [Welded: Type 6](<h9991.htm#0006>) are typically fitted inside the shell and attached by various weld types. See Annex A, Table A-3 for recommended weld sizes. 
### Fillet Welded With Shell Crimped Over
[Welded: Type 9](<h9991.htm#0009>) and [Welded: Type 10](<h9991.htm#0010>) are inserted into the shell, the end of which is crimped over at least 30° but not more than 45°. For [Welded: Type 9](<h9991.htm#0009>) the throat thickness of the external fillet weld is checked in the corroded condition. For [Welded: Type 10](<h9991.htm#0010>) the flat plate is bevelled and an external seal weld is applied. This weld size is not checked by the program. [Welded: Type 9](<h9991.htm#0009>) and [Welded: Type 10](<h9991.htm#0010>) are limited to shells with an inside diameter not exceeding 18 inches.
## Bolted Flat Covers
Using the sketch identification letters from [Bolted: Type 1](<h9991.htm#0011>) to [Bolted: Type 2](<h9991.htm#0012>) the types of bolted flat heads included in the program are described in the following subsections.
### Edge Bending
[Bolted: Type 1](<h9991.htm#0011>) is a bolted flat head or cover with a gasket contact face that is entirely within the circle enclosed by the bolts.
The required thickness _e_ of the bolted flat head is calculated in accordance with the formulae given in Clause 10.5.2 for the operating and bolting-up conditions, and is checked against the corroded thickness of the flat head. If a pass partition groove depth is specified which exceeds the internal corrosion allowance, then the actual thickness is measured to the bottom of the groove.
The minimum required edge thickness _e_ 1 at, or outside the gasket location is also calculated for the operating and bolting-up conditions.
### Facing Types
The various facing types available in the program for [Bolted: Type 1](<h9991.htm#0011>) which correspond to those commonly used for bolted flat heads are _Standard T.1a/b_ , _Tongue & Groove T.1c/d_, _Ring Type T.6_ and _O-ring_ \- see [Facing & Gasket Data](<h9985.htm>).
[Bolted: Type 2](<h9991.htm#0012>) is a bolted flat cover with a full-face gasket extending outside the bolt circle as per Figure 10.5-2.
The required thickness is calculated in accordance with Clause 10.5.3. The required thickness is checked against the corroded thickness of the flat head.
_Standard_ or _Tongue & Groove T.1c/d_ facing types should be specified when using "flat" gasket materials. _Ring Type Joint_ or _O-ring_ facing types should be specified when using ring type joints or O-ring type gaskets respectively. For a _Tongue & Groove T.1c/d_ facing with a _raised_ face on the flat cover, the facing height is also deducted from the specified new thickness of the cover.
For a raised or flat face, a confined gasket may be specified if required - see [Facings with Internally Confined Gaskets](<h9985.htm#0250>)

## Gaskets & Facings
See [Gaskets & Facings](<h0298.htm#0550>). 
## Bolting
See [Bolting](<h0298.htm#0600>) and [Bolting Data](<h9984.htm>). 
## TEMA Requirements
If required, the deflection of bolted covers may be checked in accordance with TEMA clause RCB-9.2.1. This requirement is intended to limit the deflection of bolted flat channel covers on heat exchangers to prevent loss of sealing between the gasket and the pass partition plate. For a [Bolted: Type 2](<h9984.htm#0012>) covers \(with full-face gaskets\) it is assumed that there is no edge bending due to the bolting so the second term inside the brackets in the equation for the deflection _Y_ is not considered.
The calculated deflection is checked against the TEMA recommended limits of 0.03 inches for diameters up to 24 inches, or 0.125% of the diameter for larger sizes.
## Nozzle Reinforcement
A single nozzle or opening in the flat head may be specified. An opening fitted with a nozzle must be either plain with no additional reinforcement or self reinforced as shown in [Plain nozzle](<h9993.htm#0501>) and [Self reinforced](<h9993.htm#0504>).
The nozzle to vessel attachment may be specified as _Set-on_ , _Set-in_ or _Set-through_.
The nozzle or opening may be centrally located or offset from the centre.
The reinforcement of the nozzle or opening is calculated in accordance with Figure 10.6-3 and 10.6-4.
## Test Conditions
Flat heads and covers may be checked for the shop and/or site hydrostatic test conditions by selecting the option _Check test case_.
For the test condition stresses are limited to 90% of the yield or material proof stress. Bolt stresses are limited to 150% of the design stress at room temperature.
If the design is not suitable for the test condition\(s\) appropriate warning messages will be produced. Detailed output data is not produced for the test conditions.
