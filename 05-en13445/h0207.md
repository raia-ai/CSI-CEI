# EN 13445 - Bolted Flanged Connections
* * *
# Program Capabilities
This program performs the calculations for circular bolted flanges subject to internal or external pressure, in accordance with EN 13445-3 Section 11, EN 13445-3 Annex G. or EN 1591. 
Flanges may be with or without hubs, and may be butt welded, fillet welded or lap jointed. Fillet welded flanges without hubs may be designed as integral or loose.
In addition to pressure loading the program can also take account of the effects of an applied axial force and a bending moment if required.
Bolting data for standard metric and inch series bolts is provided by the program. Physical clearances of the edge and hub are checked. Applied bolt loads for the gasket seating and operating conditions may be specified if required. A bolt spacing correction factor may also be applied, if needed, in accordance with TEMA clauses RCB-11.2.2 and RCB-RCB-11.2.3.
The requirements of TEMA Section 5 RCB-11.7 [\[26\]](<h9998.htm#0026>) for [Gaskets with Pass partition ribs](<h9985.htm#1000>) can be considered, if required.
In addition to checking the design of a flange with specified dimensions, the program also has the facility to optimise any of the following: the bolting, the gasket location, the hub length, the hub large end diameter and the flange thickness.
When the calculations have been performed the flange may be drawn on the screen to facilitate the checking of clearances and proportions. The program also calculates the approximate weight of the flange.
All thicknesses are entered in the new or as built condition. Both internal and external corrosion allowances may be specified as required - see Corrosion.
The shell to which the flange is fitted may be specified by either inside or outside diameter. A thinning allowance may be specified either as a percentage of the new thickness or as an absolute value in mm or inches. The thinning allowance is always applied to the inside surface.
NOTE: for the purposes of this program, weld factos are not taken into account and it is assumed that the materials are not cast.

# Operation using the Standard \(Taylor Forge\) method
## Flange Types
There are two basic flange types covered by the program as shown in [Flange to Shell Connections](<h9992.htm>).
Normal flanges where the bolt circle diameter is outside the shell - see Figures 11.5-1, 11.5-2 and 11.5-3.
Reverse flanges where the bolt circle diameter is inside the shell - see Figures 11.8-1 and 11.8-2. NOTE: The program permits the bolts to be located either inside or outside the gasket.
Flanges may be specified with or without a hub at the back of the flange, except for reverse fillet welded types which must be without a hub.
## Corrosion
Both internal and external corrosion allowances may be specified as required. The corrosion allowances are applied to the internal and external surfaces of the flange and the shell as shown in [Flange to Shell Connections](<h9992.htm>).
## Gaskets & Facings
See [Gaskets & Facings](<h0298.htm#0550>).
## Bolting
See [Bolting](<h0298.htm#0600>) and [Bolting Data](<h9984.htm>).
## Applied Force and Bending Moment
In addition to pressure loading the program can also take account of the effects of an axial force and a bending moment acting in a plane through the axis of the shell or nozzle to which the flange is attached. Typically these loadings may be due to wind and dead weight loadings on vessels or piping loads on nozzles. The axial force may be specified as positive or negative; a positive force being tensile. The bending moment is converted into an equivalent axial force _H_ Dm:
![](..\\img\\q0026.png)
Where _D_ m is the shell mean diameter.
NOTE: This type of loading is not specifically covered in EN 13445-3.
Calculations Calculations are in accordance with EN 13445-3 Section 11. Integral and Loose Designs Integral flanges are those where the flange and shell \(or nozzle neck\) are considered to be the equivalent of an integral structure. For fillet welded flanges the shell is considered to act as a hub, and in order for this to be valid there are restrictions on the minimum fillet weld sizes specified in ASME VIII Div.1 FIG. 2-4. These are checked by the program. Loose flanges are those where the flange has no direct connection with the shell \(lap joint\), or where the method of attachment is not considered to give the mechanical strength equivalent to that of an integral attachment. NOTE: The program will determine whether the flange is classed as loose or integral, as defined in Section 11.5, from the flange to shell connection selected, and whether or not a hub has been specified. For fillet welded flanges without hubs the user may specify whether to design the flange as integral or loose. The dimensions of partial penetration welds in optional flanges are neither input nor checked. ![](..\\img\\integvloose.png) Bolt Loads Bolt loads _W_ op and _W_ A are calculated for the operating and gasket seating \(bolting-up\) conditions respectively, in accordance with 11.5.2. NOTE 1: When a _Self-energising_ gasket is specified the hydrostatic end force _H_ is calculated using the outside diameter of the gasket. NOTE 2: For _Lap joint_ flanges the diameter _G_ is taken as the mean diameter of the contact face between the loose backing flange and the lap. The operating bolt load _W_ op is modified to include the effects of the applied axial force _H_ Df and the equivalent force _H_ Dm due to the applied moment. The maximum tensile force is used for evaluating _W_ op. The applied bolt loads for the operating and bolting-up conditions, when specified by the user, are checked against the calculated loads and the higher values are used to evaluate the required bolt cross-section area _A_ B,min and is checked against the actual cross-section area of the bolts _A_ B. The flange design bolt load _W_ is calculated in accordance with 11.5.3. If it is necessary for the flange to be suitable to withstand the full available bolt load _A_ B _f_ B,A then the user should enter a value equal to _A_ B _f_ B,A in the input as _Applied load: bolting-up_. Flange Moments Moments are calculated for the operating and bolting-up conditions generally in accordance with 11.5.3 as appropriate. SIGN CONVENTION: The sign convention used in the program is as follows: 
  * Positive loads are those which produce tension in the bolts.  
  * Moment arms are positive measured from the bolt circle diameter inwards towards the centre-line of the shell.
The hydrostatic end force _H_ D is modified to include the effects of the applied axial force _H_ Df and the equivalent force _H_ Dm due to the applied moment. The gasket load _H_ G is modified to take account of any applied bolt load in the operating condition. Moments are calculated about the bolt circle diameter _C_ in accordance with 11.5.3 \(or 11.8.1 for reverse flanges\) for the maximum tensile load, taking the positive value of _H_ Dm. Moments are also calculated about the gasket diameter _G_ for the maximum compressive load, taking the negative value of _H_ Dm. The operating moment is the larger of the moments from the two cases. NOTE: For the compressive load case, if the moment arms \(_h_ D \- _h_ G\) and \(_h_ T \- _h_ G\) are of opposite sign, the moment is taken as the larger of _H_ D\(_h_ D -_h_ G\) or _H_ T\(_h_ T \- _h_ G\). Flange Factors The flange factors _β_ T, _β_ U and _β_ Y are evaluated using the equations given in 11.5.4.1.1. The integral flange factors _β_ F and _β_ V, the loose hub factors _β_ FL and _β_ VL and the hub stress correction factor _φ_ are evaluated using the equations given in 11.5.4.1.1.a\) and b\). NOTE: For large values of _h_ / _l_ 0 and _g_ 1 / _g_ 0 outside the range of Figures 11.5-4 to 11.5-6 the equations in 11.5.4.1.2 become discontinuous, and unreliable values of the various factors may be evaluated. A warning message Ratio _g_ 1 / _g_ 0 will be given if this occurs. Flange Stresses Integral Flanges For flanges designed as integral the longitudinal hub stress _σ_ H, radial flange stress _σ_ r and tangential flange stress _σ_ θ are calculated for the operating and bolting-up conditions in accordance with 11.5.4.1.1 a\). The average stress is calculated as the greater of 1/2\(_σ_ H \+ _σ_ r\) or 1/2\(_σ_ H \+ _σ_ θ\). Loose Flanges with a Hub For loose flanges with a hub the stresses are calculated to 11.5.4.11 c\), as for integral flanges. Loose Flanges without a Hub For loose flanges without a hub the tangential flange stress is calculated for the operating and bolting-up conditions in accordance with 11.5.4.1.1. b\). The longitudinal hub stress _σ_ H and radial flange stress _σ_ r are taken as zero. Lap Joints For lap joint flanges the stresses in the loose backing flange are calculated as indicated in the paragraphs above. In addition the shear stress in the lap and the bearing stress at the contact face between the flange and the lap are also calculated for the operating and bolting-up conditions. NOTE: If the gasket width does not straddle the mean diameter of the contact face between the lap and the loose backing flange the lap will be subject to bending stresses which are not analysed by the program. A warning message will be produced if this occurs. Reverse Flanges For reverse flanges the longitudinal hub stress _σ_ H, radial flange stress _σ_ r and tangential flange stress _σ_ θ are calculated for the operating and bolting-up conditions in accordance with 11.5.4.1.1 modified as defined in 11.8. The average stress is calculated as the greater of 1/2 \(_σ_ H \+ _σ_ r\) or 1/2 \(_σ_ H \+ _σ_ θ\). Allowable Flange Design Stresses For the operating and bolting-up conditions the allowable flange design stresses are determined in accordance with 11.5.4.2, and are based on the specified allowable stresses at the design temperature and at atmospheric temperature respectively. For butt welded flanges with a hub the allowable longitudinal hub stress is the smaller of 1.5 _f_ or 1.5 _f_ H, where _f_ is the allowable stress for the flange material and _f_ H is the allowable stress for the shell material. For loose flanges with a hub the allowable longitudinal hub stress is 1.5 _f_. For butt welded flanges without a hub and for fillet welded flanges design as integral, the allowable longitudinal hub stress is the smaller of 1.5 _f_ or 1.5 _f_ H. The allowable radial, tangential and average flange stresses are equal to _f_. The allowable shear stress in the lap is 0.8 _f_ H. The allowable bearing stresses is the smaller of 1.5 _f_ or 1.5 _f_ H. Design Optimisation In addition to checking a flange with specified dimensions, the program also has the facility to optimise certain parameters - see [Design optimisation](<h9997.htm#0390>). Flange Pairs For the design of pairs of flanges it is sometimes necessary to perform the calculations separately for each flange. This situation occurs with the flanges used either side of a heat exchanger tubesheet, where the design conditions and/or gaskets are not the same; and with flanges having different inside diameters, such as those used to connect the shell cover to the shell on a floating head exchanger. The program incorporates the following features to enable these calculations to be performed correctly: Dependent on the [Bolt tightening method](<h9997.htm#0400>) selected, pre determined bolt loads can be applied. If the design bolt load is determined from a mating flange, these bolt loads can used - see [Loads across Tubesheets](<h9997.htm#0410>) The mating flange inside diameter is specified by the user so that the gasket seating width is correctly calculated for flanges with different diameters. Weld Sizes and Weld Strengths In the absence of any definitive guidance for fillet welded flanges, the weld sizes are checked to **ASME VIII Div.1 FIG. 2-4** , as follows: Fillet welded: Stepped, with a hub - checked to ASME VIII Div.1 FIG. 2-4\(3\). NOTE: The maximum recess depth is not checked. Fillet welded: Stepped, with no hub, designed as a loose flange - checked to ASME VIII Div.1 FIG. 2-4\(3a\). NOTE: The maximum recess depth is not checked. Fillet welded: Smooth, with a hub checked to ASME VIII Div.1 FIG. 2-4\(4\). NOTE: The maximum distance from the flange face is not checked. Fillet welded: Smooth, with no hub, designed as a loose flange - checked to ASME VIII Div.1 FIG. 2-4\(4a\). NOTE: The maximum distance from the flange face is not checked. Fillet welded: Stepped, with no hub, designed as an integral flange - checked to ASME VIII Div.1 FIG. 2-4\(8\). NOTE: The maximum recess depth is not checked. Fillet welded: Smooth, with no hub, designed as an integral flange - the weld at the back of the flange is checked to ASME VIII Div.1 FIG. 2-4\(8\). NOTE: The type of weld at the face of the flange is not specified and so the size is not checked. For fillet welded flanges the shear on the flange to shell welds is calculated for the operating and bolting-up conditions, and the shear in the weld leg is checked using the lower of the shell or flange allowable stresses multiplied by 0.8 - see \(13.4.5-14\). For a _Fillet welded: Smooth_ the load is considered to be carried by the outer fillet weld only. The lap to shell weld \(if any\) is not specified and so is not checked by the program. The shell is assumed to be seamless. Rigidity Index The program will calculate the rigidity index _J_ in accordance with ASME VIII Div.1 Appendix 2-14. A warning will be given if the calculated rigidity index _J_ is greater than 1.0. For lap jointed flanges the rigidity check is performed for the main flange only. NOTE: this is not a code requirement and is included for information only. Load cases For EN 13445-3 Section 11 two load cases are considered: 1 | Bolting up condition.

Flexibility flange parameters are calculated in accordance with EN 13445-3 Annex G.5.5 or EN 1591-1 Section 5.2.4. **NOTE:** Reverse flanges are not currently included in this method. Bolt parameters Bolt parameters are calculated in accordance with EN 13445-3 Annex G.5.2 or EN 1591-1 Section 5.3. Gasket parameters Gasket theoretical and effective dimensions are calculated in accordance with EN 13445-3 Annex G.5.3.1 and G.5.3.2 or EN 1591-1 Sections 5.4.2 and 5.4.3 respectively. The flexibility of the gasket is calculated in accordance with EN 13445-3 Annex G.5.3.3 or EN 1591-1 Section 6.4.4. The software does not take into account plastic deformation of the gasket **NOTE:** _c_ 1 is assumed to be zero for the EN 1591 method. **NOTE:** The Alternative Method cover narrow face joints only. Forces Internal forces in the joint are calculated in accordance with EN 13445-3 Annex G.6 or EN 1591-1 Section 6 for both applied loads and additional external loads. The compliance of the joint and the minimum forces necessary for the gasket are calculated in accordance with EN 13445-3 Annex G.6.2 and G.6.3 or EN 1591-1 Section 6.3 and 6.4 respectively. The internal forces in the assembly condition are calculated in accordance with EN 13445-3 Annex G.6.4 or EN 1591-1 Section 6.5 and the bolt-load scatter at assembly is calculated in accordance with EN 13445-3 Annex G.6.4.2 or EN 1591-1 Section 6.5.2. The internal forces in the subsequent conditions are calculated in accordance with EN 13445-3 Annex G.6.5 or EN 1591-1 Section 6.6. Load ratios The following load ratios and their respective allowables are calculated: _Component_ | _Ratio_ | _EN 13445-3 Annex G Section_ | _EN 1591 Section_
