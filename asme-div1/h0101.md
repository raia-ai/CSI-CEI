# ASME VIII Div.1 - Shells - Internal Pressure

## ASME VIII Div.1 - Shells - Internal Pressure

## Cylindrical or Conical Shells & Heads

***

## Program Capabilities

This program performs the calculations for cylindrical and conical shells and formed heads subject to internal pressure in accordance with ASME VIII Div.1 clauses UG-27, UG-32, UG-41(a) and Appendix 1 clauses 1-2 to 1-5 [\[2\]](../h9998.htm#0002). The joint efficiency _E_ is evaluated by the program in accordance with UW-12 for the types of weld and level of radiography specified. Test pressures and maximum allowable working pressures are calculated in accordance with UG-99 and UG-98 respectively. The MAWP of the shell or head is calculated both in the new and cold condition and in the hot and corroded condition. The program also calculates the internal volume and empty weight of the shell, cone or head. The weight and volume for a dished head includes the head skirt (cylindrical portion). All shell and head types may be specified by either inside or outside diameter. All thicknesses are entered in the new or as built condition. A thinning allowance may be specified either as a percentage of the new thickness or as an absolute value in mm or inches. The thinning allowance is always applied to the inside surface. Both internal and external corrosion allowances may be specified as required.

## Operation

### Cylindrical Shells

When the design pressure _P_ does not exceed 0.385 _SE_ the required thickness _t_ is calculated in accordance with UG-27(c). For higher pressures the thickness is determined in accordance with Appendix 1-2. When the thickness does not exceed half the inside radius _R_ the maximum allowable working pressures are calculated in accordance with UG-27(c). For greater thicknesses Appendix 1-2 is used.

### Conical Shells

An external axial tensile force and/or an external bending moment may be entered for use in the large and small end reinforcement calculations - see Appendix 1-5(b) definitions of _f_ 1 and _f_ 2. NOTE: If the external bending moment is large then the value of the axial load _f_ 1 in compression may exceed _PR_ L / _2_ , or the value of _f_ 2 in compression may exceed _PR_ s / 2. In this case a more detailed analysis is required - see Appendix 1-5(d) and (e). For conical shells without a knuckle at the large end the required thickness of the cone is calculated in accordance with UG-32(f). The requirements for reinforcement of the large end cone to cylinder junctions are calculated in accordance with Appendix 1-5(d). Additional stiffener area at the cone to cylinder junctions may be specified. If the stiffener design stress is lower than that of the shell, the required stiffener area is increased accordingly by the factor _k_ - see Appendix 1-5(c) and UG-41(a). For conical shells with a knuckle at the large end the required thickness of the conical portion is calculated in accordance with UG-32(g) and the required thickness of the knuckle is calculated in accordance with Appendix 1-4(d), equation (3). The limitations on knuckle radius in UG-32(h) are also checked. The requirements for reinforcement of the small end cone to cylinder junction without a knuckle are calculated in accordance with Appendix 1-5(e). Additional stiffener area at the small end cone to cylinder junction may be specified as for the large end. See also Code Interpretation VIII-1-10-06 for further guidance on cone to cylinder transitions. Because the thickness calculations for cones are based on thin shell theory, if the design pressure _P_ exceeds 0.385 _SE_ or the thickness exceeds half the inside radius a warning will be given. Below is an example of data input for cone locations, one with stiffeners at either end and one without - see also [Conical Shells](../h9987.htm). ![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/stifloc4.png)

### Ellipsoidal Heads

The required thickness _t_ is calculated in accordance with Appendix 1-4(c). For 2:1 heads with no corrosion the value of _K_ obtained from TABLE 1-4.1 is 1.00 and so equation (1) in Appendix 1-4(c) becomes identical to equation (1) in UG-32(c). The program uses the equation in 1-4(c) to calculate _K_ hence the values may not be precisely the same as the rounded values presented in TABLE 1-4.1. The requirements of footnote (90) in Appendix 1-4 are complied with when the value of _K_ is greater than 1.0. In accordance with the requirements of UG-32(k) the required thickness of the head skirt (cylindrical portion) is calculated as for a seamless shell using the formula in UG-27(c)(1). The required thickness _t_ in the output is the larger of the required thicknesses of the head and the head skirt. Because the thickness calculations for ellipsoidal heads are based on thin shell theory, if the design pressure _P_ exceeds 0.385 _SE_ or the thickness exceeds half the inside radius a warning will be given.

### Hemispherical Heads

When the design pressure _P_ does not exceed 0.665 _SE_ the required thickness _t_ is calculated in accordance with UG-27(f). For higher pressures the thickness is determined in accordance with Appendix 1-3. When the thickness does not exceed 0.356 _L_ the maximum allowable working pressures are calculated in accordance with UG-32(e). For greater thicknesses Appendix 1-3 is used. For spherical shell calculations the hemispherical head option may be selected. Equation (3) in UG-32(e) for hemispherical heads is identical to equation (3) in UG-27(d), where _L_ = _R_ = inside spherical radius. Please note, however, that the calculated weight and volume will be for a hemispherical head.

### Torispherical Heads

The required thickness _t_ is calculated in accordance with Appendix 1-4(d). The program uses the equation in 1-4(d) to calculate _M_ so the values may not be precisely the same as the rounded values presented in TABLE 1-4.2. The requirements of footnote (90) in Appendix 1-4 are complied with. In accordance with the requirements of UG-32(k) the required thickness of the head skirt (cylindrical portion) is calculated as for a seamless shell using the formula in UG-27(c)(1). The required thickness _t_ in the output is the larger of the required thicknesses of the head and the head skirt. Because the thickness calculations for torispherical heads are based on thin shell theory, if the design pressure _P_ exceeds 0.385 _SE_ or the thickness exceeds half the inside radius a warning will be given.

  Diameter limit exceeded | The shell, cone or head outside diameter exceeds the limit in TABLE UW-12 for the specified weld type.\
  Dimension limits | One or more of the following limitations in Appendix 1-4(f) have been exceeded:
* For a torispherical head, or a cone with a large end knuckle, the uncorroded inside knuckle radius is less than 6% of the shell or head outside diameter, or less than three times the thickness, in the uncorroded condition - see UG-32(g) & (i).
* For a torispherical head, the inside spherical radius exceeds the outside diameter of head in the corroded condition - see UG-32(i) - see ASME interpretation VIII-1-86-175.\
  &#xNAN;_&#x45;ccentric cone_ | One side of the eccentric cone is parallel to the adjacent shell centre lines, i.e. angle _α_ 1 is twice that of the equivalent concentric cone and angle _α_ 2 is zero. See UG-36 Note (2).\
  Full radiography reqd | The shell, cone or head thickness exceeds 1.5" and full radiography has not been specified - see UW-11(a)(2).\

  Head shape | One or more of the following limitations have been exceeded:
* For an ellipsoidal head, the ratio _D_ / 2 _h_ is greater than 3.0 - see TABLE 1-4.1.
* For a torispherical head, the ratio _L_ / _r_ is greater than 16.667 - see TABLE 1-4.2 NOTE (1).
* The r/D ratio exceeds the limits in TABLE 1-4.4.\
  Insufficient reinforcement | The area requirements for reinforcement at the large or small end of a cone have not been met.\
  &#xNAN;_&#x4B;nuckle buckling_ | Knuckle buckling per Appendix 1-4(f) governs the design.\
  &#xNAN;_&#x4C;ow temperature_ | Further analysis per UCS-66 may be required - see [Limitations](../h9996.htm#0700).\
  MAWP new & cold | One or more warnings have occurred in the as built and uncorroded condition. Run this calculation without corrosion for more information.\
  &#xNAN;_&#x50;ressure load_ | The sign on the axial load _f_ 1 or _f_ 2 reduces the total axial load _Q S_ or _Q L_. This loading case may not be the governing case.\
  Ring location | The location of a stiffening ring is too far from a cone/shell junction (_0.25 √Rt s_) or is located on a knuckle.\
  &#xNAN;_&#x53;traight flange_ | For an ellipsoidal or torispherical head the required thickness of the cylindrical or straight flange portion of the head governs the total required thickness.\
  Temperature limit exceeded | The design temperature exceeds the limit in TABLE 1-4.3, the limiting value will be displayed.\
  Thick shell theory reqd | For a conical shell or a dished head, the design pressure _P_ exceeds 0.385 _SE_ or the thickness exceeds half the inside radius.\
  &#xNAN;_&#x54;hick shell theory used_ | For a cylindrical shell or a hemispherical head the thickness and/or MAWP has been calculated to Appendix 1-2 or 1-3 - see UG-27(c)(1), UG-27(d) and UG-32(e).\
  Thickness limit exceeded | The shell, cone or head thickness exceeds the limit in TABLE UW-12 for the specified weld type.\
  Total reqd thk | The total required thickness of the shell, cone or head, inclusive of corrosion and thinning allowances, exceeds the new or as built thickness. The required thickness is indicated.\
  U-2(g) | The applied loads are such that a more detailed analysis is required per U-2(g).\
  UG-16(b): Min thk | The shell, cone or head thickness less corrosion and thinning allowances is less than 1/16" (1.5mm) - see UG-16(b). NOTE: the exceptions detailed in subparagraphs (1) to (5) are not checked.\
  UG-32(g): Knuckle reqd | The cone half apex angle exceeds 30° hence a knuckle is mandatory at the large end, unless the design complies with the requirements of Appendix 1-5(g) (special analysis required) - see UG-32(g).\
  Fatal Warning Messages See [Fatal Messages](../h9997.htm#0502). Additional loads | Under certain cone/shell geometries, due to short comings in the method, it is not possible to calculate the effects of additional loads. In these circumstances a special analysis is required.\
  \---|---\
  Bad Xray/Weld selection | An invalid combination of weld type and radiography has been selected.\
  Dia and/or thk invalid | A diameter and/or thickness is zero or the thickness exceeds the radius.\
