# Allowable Stresses
Maximum allowable stress of the material should be entered as given in ASME II, Part D, Subpart 1, Table 1A, 1B or 3. 
Restrictions: 
* For cast materials see strength reduction factors in UG-24. 
* For nozzles in welded pipe or tubing, see the additional restrictions in UG-37 for the definition of _S_. 
* * *
# Test Pressures
Test pressure conditions are checked against 90%_S y_ for membrane stress based calculations or, alternatively, allowable loads are increased by 130%.
Guidance on the use of the 90% limit may be found in ASME II Part D Mandatory Appendices 1 and 2. See also Note 5 to Table 1A. Note that UG-99\(d\), states that 90%_S y_ limit may not protect against _"visible distortion"_ for all material and component types and further checks may be required.
The option _Check test case \(Menu\)_ has been included to permit the software to perform a check that the test case, if higher than standard, governs the design. In most modules no output is produced if this check is passed. Select _Yes_ to perform a test case assessment generally as above. _Shop test pressure_ must be input, _Site test pressure_ is optional.
For the shop test condition the thickness used is the new thickness less any thinning allowance. For the site test condition the corrosion allowances are also deducted. Except as noted, the static head effects \(if any\) of the test media should be included in the test pressure.
For complex components deflection/distortion, which is not checked, may be the limiting factor.

# Weld Types
For all shell and head types two welds must be specified. For cylindrical and conical shells these are the longitudinal and circumferential seam welds, and for dished heads they are the seam weld in the head and the head to shell weld. If there is no weld then seamless should be selected, as in the case of a seamless pipe shell. The weld type numbers are as defined in TABLE UW-12. The program will only permit valid weld types to be selected as shown in Table below. NOTE: _Type 7_ welds are for use in Finglow 3D only.
**Shell or Head Type Weld** | **Category** | **Permissible weld types**  
---|---|---  
Cylindrical or Longitudinal | A | Seamless, 1, 2 or 4  
Conical Shell Circumferential | B | Seamless, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6  
Torispherical or Head | A | Seamless, 1 or 2  
Ellipsoidal Head to shell | B | Seamless, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6  
Hemispherical Head | A | Seamless, 1 or 2  
Head to shell | A | Seamless, 1, 2, 3 or 6  
* * *
# Joint Efficiency
For longitudinal welds in shells or cones, and seam welds in ellipsoidal or torispherical heads, the joint efficiency _E_ is determined from TABLE UW-12 for the specified joint type and radiography. If the longitudinal or head weld radiography is set at _Full_ , and the circumferential or head to shell weld radiography is set at _None_ , then the joint efficiency _E_ is reduced to the value from column \(b\) in TABLE UW-12 - see UW-12\(a\). This does not apply if the circumferential or head to shell joint is seamless.
For hemispherical heads joint efficiencies are determined from TABLE UW-12 for both the head weld and the head to shell weld, for the specified joint types and radiography. The joint efficiency _E_ for the hemispherical head is the lower of the two values - see UG-32\(b\), definition of _E_.
When the longitudinal joint in a shell or cone, or the main joint in a head is specified as seamless, the joint efficiency _E_ \(or more correctly, the quality factor\) is determined in accordance with UW-12\(d\). It should be noted that, if no radiography is specified for the circumferential or head to shell weld then the joint efficiency is reduced to 0.85. This does not apply if the circumferential or head to shell joint is seamless.
NOTE: For calculation of reinforcement at the large and small ends of a cone, the joint efficiency is evaluated as above. Since it is not possible to readily determine whether the longitudinal weld is in compression - see Appendix 1, clause 1-5\(b\) - the option to take the joint efficiency as 1.0 is not used.
* * *
# Radiography
For each weld the level of radiography to be applied must be selected. It should be noted that UW-11 permits different levels of radiography to be specified for each weld, subject to certain restrictions. The program will only permit valid levels of radiography to be selected for each weld type. For Type _1_ and _2_ welds radiography may be _Full_ , _Spot_ or _None_. For all other weld types, including seamless, only _None_ may be selected.
* * *
# Gaskets & Facings
The facing types available in the program correspond to those shown in TABLE 2-5.2. In addition, an O-ring groove facing type is available for rubber O-ring joints - see [Facing & Gasket Data](<h9985.htm>). 
NOTE: For facings with a serrated finish, the serration size is not input and is not therefore checked by the program. The user must ensure that the correct facing type is selected. 
The gaskets available in the program correspond to those shown in TABLE 2-5.1. A list of the available gasket types is given in [Gasket types](<h9985.htm#0300>). The appropriate values for the gasket factor _m_ and gasket seating stress _y_ for the selected gasket material are supplied automatically by the program. In addition, a _User defined_ option is available to enable the user to enter specific values of gasket factor _m_ and gasket seating stress _y_ for gasket not listed in TABLE 2-5.1. 
NOTE: Not all combinations of gasket and facing type are permitted - see [Gasket types](<h9985.htm#0300>) and TABLE 2-5.1 right hand column. 
See also [Mating flanges and facings](<h9985.htm#0200>) and [Gaskets with Pass partition ribs](<h9985.htm#1000>). 
The gasket width is checked for possible crushing during bolting-up using the value from TABLE 2-4 or the following formula from Taylor Forge Modern Flange Design:

# Bolting
Bolt cross-section areas and recommended clearances are provided automatically by the program. Two bolt tables are currently available: 
  * ISO metric series bolting to BS 3643 Parts 1 and 2 - see [\[12\]](<h9998.htm#0012>). The available bolt sizes range from M3 to M150.  
  * Inch series bolting to BS 1580 Parts 1 and 2 \(in accord with the corresponding sections of ANSI B1.1\) - see [\[4\]](<h9998.htm#0004>) and [\[10\]](<h9998.htm#0010>). The available bolt sizes range from 1/4 inch to 4 inch.
Data for the bolting is given in [Bolting Data](<h9984.htm>), together with an explanation of the methods used to calculate the root areas of the bolts.
Recommended minimum clearances are based on TEMA TABLE D-5 - see [\[26\]](<h9998.htm#0026>).
In addition to the standard bolt tables a _User defined_ option is available to enable the user to enter specific values for the following items of data: 
  * Diameter  
  * Bolt area  
  * Minimum bolt pitch  
  * Minimum edge clearance
* * *
# Diameter and Thickness Limits
The program checks that the diameter and thickness in the uncorroded condition are within the limits specified in TABLE UW-12 for the specified weld type. Warning messages _Diameter limit exceeded_ or _Thickness limit exceeded_ will be given if the limits are exceeded.
**Weld** | **Type** | **Maximum Thickness** | **Maximum Diameter**  
---|---|---|---  
Shell Longitudinal weld | 4 | 0.375" | -  
| 3 | 0.625" | 24" OD  
Shell circumferential welds | 4 | 0.625" | -  
and head to shell welds | 5 | 0.5" | 24" OD  
| 6 | 0.25" | 24" OD  
If the thickness exceeds 1.5" then _Full_ radiography is mandatory for all butt welds - see UW-11\(a\)\(2\). This is checked by the program.
NOTE: The thickness above which full radiography is mandatory is also governed by the material type, and in many cases the limit is less than 1.5" - see UW-11\(a\)\(2\). These restrictions are not checked by the program.
* * *
# Yield strength and Minimum tensile strength
The specified minimum yield strength for the material should be entered as given in ASME II, Part D, Subpart 1, Table 1A or 1B\(at room temperature\) or Table Y-1\(at elevated temperature\).
NOTE: When using the Material Database, the software will use the rules in UG-23\(f\) to calculate the yield strength if the material is not listed in Table Y-1.
The minimum tensile strength _R m_ for the material should be entered as given in ASME II, Part D, Subpart 1, Table 1A or 1B\(at room temperature\) or Table U\(at elevated temperature\).
* * *
# Service Restrictions
The selection of weld type and/or radiography is also governed by the Service Restrictions \(e.g. lethal or low temperature service\) specified in UW-2. These restrictions are beyond the scope of the program.
* * *
# Shells & Heads
The following shell and head types may be selected:
### Cylindrical Shells
### Conical Shells
### Eccentric cones
Concentric conical shells with or without knuckles at the large and small ends may be specified. If the knuckle radius is zero then the program assumes that no knuckle is present.
Eccentric conical shells with or without knuckles at the large and small ends may be specified subject to the limitations given in UG-36\(g\). If the knuckle radius is zero then the program assumes that no knuckle is present.
The cone geometry may be defined by specifying either the cone half apex angle or alternatively the cone length. Whichever is specified the program will calculate the other dimension.
![](..\\img\\offcone.png)
### Ellipsoidal Heads
Ellipsoidal heads may be selected as either a standard 2:1 ellipsoidal head where the height of the head \(measured from the tan-line\) is a quarter of the diameter of the head skirt, or a general ellipsoidal head where the head height is specified by the user. For a 2:1 head, if internal dimensions have been specified the inside head height is determined from the inside diameter, and for external dimensions the outside head height is determined from the outside diameter \(all in the uncorroded condition\).
### Hemispherical Heads
Hemispherical heads intended for connection to a cylindrical shell may be selected.
For spherical shells the hemispherical head option may be selected. Please note, however, that the calculated weight and volume will be for a hemispherical head.
### Torispherical Heads
Torispherical heads may be selected as either a standard DIN Korbbogen head, with a crown radius 80% of the head outside diameter and a knuckle radius approximately 15.4% of the outside diameter, or a general torispherical head where the crown and knuckle radii are specified by the user.
* * *
# External Pressure Charts
External pressure chart numbers are given for each ASME material specification and grade in ASME II, PART D, Subpart 1, TABLES 1A and 1B -see [\[1\]](<h9998.htm#0001>).
To avoid step changes in calculated values of factor _A_ and/or stress _B_ , the tabulated values given are used only when the proportional limit is exceeded. In all other cases values are calculated from the equation _B_ =_AE_ /2.

# Shell & Head stresses
ASME VIII Div.1 does not provide rules for the combination of localised bending stresses resulting from mechanical loads at supports with the general primary membrane stress resulting from pressure. The following allowable stress factors are therefore recommendations only.
Pressure stress - For openings in shells PD 5500 W.6.2.2.3 recommends a multiplication factor of 2.25 if the stress concentration factor is calculated in accordance with the Decock method; alternatively ASME VIII Div.2 Section 5.5.6.1\(d\) suggests 3.0.
Shear stress - The recommended value of the multiplication factor to obtain the allowable shear stress in the shell is 0.6 - see ASME VIII Div.2 Section 4.5.14.
Membrane stress - The recommended value of the multiplication factor to obtain the allowable membrane stress in the shell is 1.5 - see ASME VIII Div.2 Section 5.2.2.4 and Figure 5.1. NOTE: If the membrane stress cannot be classified as a local primary membrane stress \(i.e. if the stress is not self-limiting\) then a value of 1.0 should be used - see ASME VIII Div.2 Table 5.6 and Figure 5.1.
Membrane plus bending stress - The recommended value of the multiplication factor to obtain the allowable membrane plus bending stress in the shell is 3.0 - see ASME VIII Div.2 Section 5.5.6.1\(d\). NOTE: If the stress cannot be classified as a secondary membrane plus bending stress \(i.e. if the stress is not self-limiting\) then a value of 1.5 should be used - see ASME VIII Div.2, Table 5.6 and Figure 5.1.
Surface stress - The recommended value of the multiplication factor to obtain the allowable surface stress in the shell is 3.0 - see ASME VIII Div.2 Section 5.5.6.1\(d\).
* * *
# Nozzle stresses
ASME VIII Div.1 does not provide rules for the combination of localised bending stresses resulting from mechanical loads at supports with the general primary membrane stress resulting from pressure. The following allowable stress factors are therefore recommendations only.
Shear stress - The recommended value of the multiplication factor to obtain the allowable shear stress in the nozzle is 0.7 - see ASME VIII Div.1, UG-45\(c\).
Membrane stress - The recommended value of the multiplication factor to obtain the allowable membrane stress in the nozzle is 1.0 - see ASME VIII Div.2 Section 5.2.2.4 and Figure 5.1. NOTE: The membrane stress in the nozzle cannot normally be classified as a local primary membrane stress - see ASME VIII Div.2 Table 5.6.
Membrane plus bending stress - The recommended value of the multiplication factor to obtain the allowable membrane plus bending stress in the nozzle is 1.5 - see ASME VIII Div.2 Section 5.2.2.4. NOTE: The membrane plus bending stress in the nozzle cannot normally be classified as a secondary membrane plus bending stress - see ASME VIII Div.2, Table 5.6.
Surface stress - The recommended value of the multiplication factor to obtain the allowable surface stress in the nozzle is 3.0 - see ASME VIII Div.2 Section 5.5.6.1\(d\)
