# ASME VIII Div.1 - Floating Tubesheets
* * *
# Program Capabilities
The program can analyse the effects of pressure on floating head tubesheet exchangers, generally in accordance with ASME VIII Div.1 Section UHX or TEMA. Note: Configurations \(b\) & \(c\) in Figure 4.18.10 are not currently supported.
The exchanger comprises a shell, a tube bundle and in the case of floating head tubesheet exchangers two equal thickness tubesheets. Channels are considered to be cylindrical.
The design of tube-to-tubesheet welds in accordance with UW-20 is not included.
The program has a Design Option to determine the minimum required thickness of the tubesheet\(s\).
Note that dimensional requirements should be manually checked for compliance with TEMA.
Note that the joint efficiency _E_ is assumed equal to 1 for shells and tubes.
Note that the Floating Tubesheet configuration currently does not include the elastic-plastic option to 4.18.9.5.
* * *
# Operation
The program analyses the following:- 
  * Tubes: Tensile and compressive longitudinal stresses due to pressure. Circumferential membrane stress due to pressure, tubes are not checked for collapse due to external pressure.  
  * Tubesheet: Bending and shear stresses due to pressure and additionally edge bending due to bolting, if applicable.  
  * Tube/Tubesheet joints: Tube end loads due to pressure.
Examples of various exchanger configurations are detailed in diagrams below - see [Channel-TS-Shell Connections](<h9989.htm#0100>).

## Design Conditions
The program can process five conditions simultaneously. Additional conditions can be handled by repeated use of the program. The type of condition under consideration may be specified as new or corroded, design or test:
_New:Des_  
_Cor:Des_  
_New:Tst_  
_Cor:Tst_  
The program does not consider differential design conditions which may require agreement between the Manufacturer and the End User.
## Tube End Types
See [Tube End Types](<h0198.htm#1400>)
## Corrosion
Corrosion allowances may be specified for both internal and external surfaces of the shell and channel, as required. Corrosion allowances for the tubesheet are separately specified for the shellside and the tubeside.
For new or as built conditions any input corrosion allowances will be ignored.
NOTE: Corrosion is not applied to tube surfaces, as these are normally considered as consumables. If corrosion is required then the corroded tube dimensions should be input.
## Joint efficiency
For the purposes of assessing the stresses, no account is taken of joint efficiencies and _E_ is assumed to be 1.0. Any variation of _E_ should be entered by adjusting the value of allowable stress.
## Test conditions
See [Test Pressures](<h0198.htm#0200>) for the calculation of the allowable stresses and loads in the test conditions.
## Gaskets & Facings
See [Gaskets & Facings](<h0198.htm#0550>). 
## Bolting
See [Bolting](<h0198.htm#0600>) and [Bolting Data](<h9984.htm>).

## Warning and Advisory Messages
Messages printed below in _italics_ are not considered to be critical - see [Warnings Messages](<h9997.htm#0501>).
_Acceptable calculation_ | The calculations have been performed successfully.

_Bolt circle : max_ | The bolt circle diameter is too large to comply with the recommended bolt clearances. The value displayed shows the recommended maximum.  
_Bolt circle : min_ | The bolt circle diameter is too small to comply with the recommended bolt clearances. The value displayed shows the recommended minimum.  
Bolt stress | The bolt stress limit has been exceeded.  
_Bolt tensioning recommended_ | The nominal bolt diameter exceeds 38 mm - see PD 5500 3.8.1.4, or the _Probable wrench load_ predicted by ASME VIII, Div.1 Nonmandatory Appendix S is less than the actual bolt load. The use of bolt tensioning or torque tightening equipment is recommended.  
_Bolt tightening controlled_ | The bolt stress has exceeded the nominal code limit but may be acceptable for controlled bolt tightening if agreed between the designer, manufacturer and inspection authority. See also, ASME VIII, Div.1 Nonmandatory Appendix S.  
Buckling length kl | The tube buckling stress exceeds the allowable.  
Code limitations exceeded | One or more of the limitations specified in ASME VIII Div.1 for the component have been exceeded. Use of the _Shells - Internal Pressure_ module will give detailed warning messages.  
_Contact width N\(min\)_ | The gasket width _N_ is less than the minimum recommended in Taylor Forge Modern Flange Design to avoid possible crushing during bolting-up - see [Gaskets & Facings](<h0198.htm#0550>).
