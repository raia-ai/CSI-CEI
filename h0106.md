# ASME VIII Div.1 - Local Loads on Formed Heads
# to WRC Bulletin 107/537
* * *
# Program Capabilities
This program performs the calculations for the assessment of stresses due to local loading on formed heads in accordance with ASME VIII Div.1 Appendix G-9, Welding Research Council Bulletin 107/537 "Local Stresses in Spherical and Cylindrical Shells due to External Loadings" [\[29\]](<h9998.htm#0029>).
The nomenclature used in the program output is generally in accordance with WRC 107/537 sections 1.1 and 1.2, except that _S_ is used in place of s.
The stresses at the edge of a nozzle or solid attachment and at the edge of a reinforcing pad or insert plate are calculated to WRC 107/537 section 3. The stresses in the nozzle are calculated using the method in WRC 297 section 3.1. The membrane stresses due to internal pressure are calculated to ASME VIII Div.1, UG-32\(e\) or Appendix 1-3 as appropriate. The summation of stresses is in accordance with WRC 107/537 Table 2 or 3.
The membrane stresses in the nozzle neck due the combined effect of pressure and external loads are checked by the program. The calculation method employed is described in PD 5500 Annex B. External moments and shear forces are combined vectorially as applicable. A warning message is displayed if the allowable design stress is exceeded.
The deflection and rotations are evaluated using the factors from WRC 34 "Computation of the Stresses from Local Loads in Spherical Pressure Vessels or Pressure Vessel Heads" [\[28\]](<h9998.htm#0028>).
The head may be specified by either inside or outside diameter. Nozzles may be specified by nominal bore, inside diameter or outside diameter. All thicknesses are entered in the new or as built condition. Thinning allowance may be specified for the head and the nozzles, either as a percentage of the new thickness or as an absolute value in mm or inches. Thinning allowances are always applied to the inside surface. Both internal and external corrosion allowances may be specified as required.
The calculations are not valid for nozzles or attachments located in the knuckle region of a torispherical head, or outside the central 80% of the diameter of an ellipsoidal head.

# Operation
## Attachment Types
The following types of attachment are covered by the program: 
  * _Nozzle_ \- The following types of nozzles and openings may be selected - see [Nozzles and Openings](<h0103.htm#0230>): 
_Plain nozzle_
_Nozzle + single pad_
_Nozzle + double pad_
_Self reinforced_
_Butt welded insert_
_Pad_
  * _Solid circular_ \- A circular attachment which does not penetrate the head. NOTE: The attachment itself may be hollow, as in the case of a lifting trunnion, but the stresses are calculated as if the attachment was solid.  
  * _Square_ \- A square attachment \(equal length and width\). NOTE: The attachment itself may be hollow, as in the case of a "box" type bracket, but the stresses are calculated as if the attachment was solid.
## Joint Efficiency
For the purposes of assessing the stress in the head the joint efficiency _E_ is assumed to be 1.0, as the loads are considered to be remote from any main weld. Any variation of _E_ should be entered by adjusting the value of allowable stress. 
## Loadings and Sign Convention
The following loadings may be specified for any type of attachment: see [Loadings and Sign Convention Heads](<h9981.htm#0020>). 
  * _Load X \(shear\)_ \- This corresponds to the load _V_ 1 in WRC 107/537.  
  * _Load Y \(shear\)_ \- This corresponds to the load _V_ 2 in WRC 107/537.  
  * _Load Z \(radial\)_ \- This corresponds to the load -_P_ in WRC 107/537. NOTE: The sign convention for the load _P_ in WRC 107/537 is opposite to that used for Load Z by this program.  
  * _Moment X_ \- This corresponds to the moment -_M_ 1 in WRC 107/537. NOTE: The sign convention for the moment _M_ 1 in WRC 107/537 is opposite to that used for _Moment X_ by this program.  
  * _Moment Y_ \- This corresponds to the moment _M_ 2 in WRC 107/537.  
  * _Moment Z_ \- This corresponds to the moment _M_ T in WRC 107/537.
## Rotation of Axes
The program includes a facility for converting the loading data from any arbitrary set of axes to those defined in [Loadings and Sign Convention Heads](<h9981.htm#0020>). This type of rotation is typically required for offset radial nozzles.
This is achieved by rotation about each axis as required. The operation of this facility is explained in [Rotation of Axes Example](<h9981.htm#0030>).
## Head Types
See [Shells & Heads](<h0198.htm#1000>) for available head types. The calculation assumes the nozzle or attachment is located entirely within the spherical or crown portion of the head.
## Internal Pressure
For all types of nozzle and other attachments the membrane stresses in the head due to internal pressure are calculated and added to the stresses in the head due to the local loads. When a reinforcing pad or insert plate is specified the pressure stresses are calculated using the combined head and pad thickness. The membrane stresses due to pressure are calculated in accordance with UG-32\(e\), for the inside spherical radius _L_ , by re-arranging the equations to give the stress _S_. For ellipsoidal heads the equivalent inside spherical radius is calculated as _K_ 1 _D_ , where _D_ is the inside diameter of the head and _K_ 1 is obtained from ASME VIII Div.1 TABLE UG-37.
Optionally a stress concentration factor can be input to take account of the effects of any opening. Altenatively the program will calculate a scf based on PD 5500 W.6.2.2.3.
For nozzles the longitudinal and circumferential membrane stresses in the nozzle due to internal pressure are calculated and added to the stresses in the nozzle due to the local loads. When the thickness does not exceed half the inside radius the membrane stresses due to pressure are calculated in accordance with UG-27\(c\). For greater thicknesses Appendix 1-2 is used. In both cases the equations are re-arranged to give the stress _S_.
## Calculation of Stresses
### Edge Of Nozzle
The stresses in the head at the edge of a nozzle are calculated to WRC 107/537 section 3.3. The nozzle and head are assumed to be symmetrical about the centre-line of the nozzle, so the bending moments X and Y are combined into a single moment _M_ acting about an axis at an angle θ to the X axis \(measured in an anti-clockwise direction as shown in WRC 107/537 Fig. 1\). The shear loads X and Y are resolved into loads _V_ 1 acting along the axis of moment _M_ , and _V_ 2 acting at right angles to _V_ 1.
For butt welded insert nozzles the head thickness _T_ is taken as the corroded thickness of the insert plate. For nozzles with reinforcing pads the thickness _T_ is taken as the combined head plus pad thickness, less corrosion and thinning allowance.
NOTE: The specified thinning allowance is not applied to reinforcing pads and insert plates.
The value of the shell parameter _U_ is calculated to WRC 107/537 subsection 3.2.1. The nozzle parameters _Y = r_ m /_t_ and _ρ_ =  _T_ /  _t_ are calculated to WRC 107/537 subsection 3.2.2.2.
The dimensionless membrane forces and bending moments are evaluated from WRC 107/537 Figures SP-1 to SP-10 for the radial load _P_ , and Figures SM-1 to SM-10 for the moment _M_.
NOTE: All the values of the dimensionless membrane forces and bending moments from these figures are taken as positive. The appropriate signs are applied in the stress summation tables.
Logarithmic interpolation is used for the nozzle parameters _Y_ and _ρ_ and linear interpolation is used for the shell parameter _U_. If _Y_ is less than 5.0 or greater than 50.0 the value of the dimensionless membrane force or bending moment at the limit value of _Y_ is used. If _ρ_ is less than 0.25 or greater than 10.0 the value of the dimensionless membrane force or bending moment at the limit value of _ρ_ is used. If the value of _U_ is greater than 2.2 the value of the dimensionless membrane force or bending moment at the limit value of _U_ is used. Appropriate warning messages will be produced if any of these parameters are out of range.
The data used by the program includes extrapolations of the curves in WRC 107/537. If any extrapolated values are used a warning message will be produced.
Shear stresses are calculated in accordance with WRC 107/537 subsection 3.3.3 and 3.3.4.1.
### In Nozzle
The stresses in the nozzle at the nozzle to head junction are calculated using the method from WRC 297 subsection 3.1. The equations used are as follows:
Circumferential membrane stress due to radial load _P_
![](..\\img\\q0013.png)
Circumferential membrane stress due to moment _M_
![](..\\img\\q0014.png)
Longitudinal membrane stress due to radial load _P_
![](..\\img\\q0015.png)
Longitudinal bending stress due to radial load _P_
![](..\\img\\q0016.png)
Longitudinal membrane stress due to moment _M_
![](..\\img\\q0017.png)
Longitudinal bending stress due to moment _M_
![](..\\img\\q0018.png)
NOTE: The circumferential bending stresses in the nozzle are assumed to be negligible - see WRC 297 subsection 3.1.
Shear stresses are calculated in accordance with WRC 297 subsection 3.3 equations \(11\) and \(12\).
### Edge Of Solid Attachment
The stresses in the head at the edge of a solid attachment are calculated to WRC 107/537 section 3.3. For solid circular attachments the attachment and head are assumed to be symmetrical about the centre-line of the attachment, so the bending moments X and Y are combined into a single moment _M_ acting about an axis at an angle θ to the X axis \(measured in an anti-clockwise direction as shown in WRC 107/537 Fig. 1\). The shear loads X and Y are resolved into loads _V_ 1 acting along the axis of moment _M_ , and _V_ 2 acting at right angles to _V_ 1.
For attachments with insert plates the head thickness _T_ is taken as the corroded thickness of the insert plate. For attachments with reinforcing pads the thickness _T_ is taken as the combined head plus pad thickness, less corrosion and thinning allowance. For attachments with pads pressure stress is concidered to act in the head only.
NOTE: The specified thinning allowance is not applied to reinforcing pads and insert plates.
The value of the shell parameter _U_ is calculated to WRC 107/537 subsection 3.2.1.
The dimensionless membrane forces and bending moments are evaluated from WRC 107/537 Fig. SR-2 for the radial load _P_ , and Fig. SR-3 for the moments _M_ 1 and _M_ 2.
NOTE: All the values of the dimensionless membrane forces and bending moments from these figures are taken as positive. The appropriate signs are applied in the stress summation tables.
Linear interpolation is used for the shell parameter _U_. If the value of _U_ is greater than 2.2 the value of the dimensionless membrane force or bending moment at the limit value of _U_ is used. An appropriate warning message will be produced if this parameter is out of range.
Shear stresses are calculated in accordance with WRC 107/537 subsection 3.3.3 and 3.3.4.1 for solid circular attachments, or 3.3.4.2 for square attachments. The shear stress due to the torsional moment _M_ T on a square attachment is calculated using the following formula:
![](..\\img\\q0019.png)
### Edge Of Reinforcing Pad Or Insert Plate
The stresses in the head at the edge of a reinforcing pad or insert plate are calculated to WRC 107/537 section 3.3, as for the stresses at the edge of a solid attachment. The edge of an insert plate is taken as the large end of the taper, and the head thickness _T_ is taken as the head thickness less corrosion and thinning allowance.
## Stress Summation
The summation of the stresses at the edge of the nozzle or attachment, due to the various loads and moments, is carried out at the inside and outside surface of the head or pad at four points around the nozzle or attachment in accordance with WRC 107/537 Table 2 or Table 3. For square attachments points _A_ and _B_ are on the X axis and points _C_ and _D_ are on the Y axis. Because the two moments are combined into a single moment for nozzles and solid circular attachments the points at which the stresses are evaluated may not lie on the X and Y axes. The summation tables are presented in terms of the angle relative to the axis of the combined moment _M_. Points _A_ and _B_ correspond to angles 0° and 180° respectively, and points _C_ and _D_ correspond to angles 90° and 270° respectively.
When a pad or insert plate is fitted the summation of stresses is likewise carried out at the inside and outside surfaces of the head at the edge of the pad or insert plate.
For a nozzle, the summation of stresses is also carried out at the outside and inside surfaces of the nozzle at the nozzle to head junction.
For nozzles and solid circular attachments the stresses at points 0° and 180° due to the moment _M_ are assumed to be zero. For square attachments the stresses at points _A_ and _B_ due to the moment _M_ 1 are assumed to be zero, and similarly, the stresses at points _C_ and _D_ due to the moment _M_ 2 are assumed to be zero.
The + and - signs in WRC 107/537 Table 2 and Table 3 indicate whether the calculated stress at that point should be multiplied by +1 or -1.
NOTE: The circumferential and longitudinal membrane stresses due to internal pressure are included in the stress summation. The software will check the membrane stress due to loadings combined with the plain pressure stress. The resultant membrane stress intensity is then checked _._
## Stress Intensities
The total tangential and radial membrane stresses, smy \(_S_ my\) and smx \(_S_ mx\), are combined with the total shear stress t \(tau\), and the membrane stress intensity _S_ m is taken as the largest absolute value of stresses _S_ m1, _S_ m2 and _S_ m3 which are calculated as follows:
![](..\\img\\q0020.png)
![](..\\img\\q0021.png)
![](..\\img\\q0022.png)
Similarly, the total tangential and radial membrane plus bending stresses, sy \(_S_ y\) and sx \(_S_ x\), are combined with the total shear stress, t \(tau\), and the total stress intensity _S_ is taken as the largest absolute value of stresses _S_ 1, _S_ 2 and _S_ 3 which are calculated as follows:
![](..\\img\\q0023.png)
![](..\\img\\q0024.png)
![](..\\img\\q0025.png)
## Allowable Stresses
The allowable values for shear stress, membrane stress intensity and total membrane plus bending stress intensity are determined by multiplying the maximum allowable stress for the appropriate material by factors which are specified by the user. The recommended values for these factors are given below. If zero is entered for one or more of the factors then the message Invalid data will be displayed and the recommended value will be inserted into the input. Values which exceed twice the recommended values are not permitted.
### Head Stresses
See - [Shell & Head Stresses](<h0198.htm#1200>)
### Nozzle stresses
See - [Nozzle Stresses](<h0198.htm#1300>)
## Deflection and Rotations
For nozzles and attachments the deflection _D_ z due to the radial load _P_ is evaluated using the factor from WRC 34 "Computation of the Stresses from Local Loads in Spherical Pressure Vessels or Pressure Vessel Heads" by P. P. Bijlaard, March 1957, Fig. 2, and the rotations _R_ x and _R_ y due to the moments _M_ 1 and _M_ 2 are evaluated using the factor from Fig. 8. Linear interpolation is used for the shell parameter _S_ in these figures. If the value of _S_ exceeds 4.0 the limit value is used and a warning message is produced.
For a nozzle or attachment with a reinforcing pad or insert plate, the deflections and rotations are calculated at the edge of the reinforcing pad or insert plate.
## Pipe and Shell Flexibility
When considering the loadings on nozzles due to attached piping it is possible for the program to calculate a reduced radial load and reduced moments using a linear interpolation of the shell and pipe spring characteristics. To use this facility data must be entered for the free end rotations _R_ x and _R_ y and the free end deflection _D_ z.
For details of this facility please refer to [Pipe and Shell Flexibility](<h9997.htm#0900>).
NOTE: The signs of the free end deflection and rotations must be the same as those of the corresponding load and moments.
## General Limitations
WRC 107/537 Appendix A.2 contains three limitations which are checked by the program. If the ratio _D_ m / _T_ is less than 20.0 or less than \(4 + 16 _S_\), then the thin shell theory used is not considered to be valid - see Fig. A-1. If the ratio _d_ m /  _D_ m \(_r_ o /  _R m_ for solid attachment, _r_ m / _R m_ for nozzles\) is greater than 1/3 the shallow shell theory used in the method may not be valid - see Fig. A-1.

# System Messages
## Warning and Advisory Messages
Messages printed below in _italics_ are not considered to be critical - see [Warnings Messages](<h9997.htm#0501>).
_Acceptable calculation_ | The calculations have been performed successfully and the calculated stresses are less than the corresponding allowable stresses.  
---|---  
Code limitations exceeded | One or more of the limitations specified in ASME VIII Div.1 for the component have been exceeded. Use of the _Shells - Internal Pressure_ module will give detailed warning messages.  
Diameter limit exceeded | The shell outside diameter exceeds the limit in TABLE UW-12 for the specified weld type.  
_Factor S out of range_ | Factor _S_ is greater than 4.0 - see WRC 34 Fig. 2 and 8. The deflection factors at the limit value are used.  
Factor U out of range | Factor _U_ is outside the range of one or more of the specific curves - see WRC 107/537 Fig. SR-2 and SR-3, SP-1 to SP-10, and SM-1 to SM-10. The dimensionless membrane forces and bending moments at the limit value are used. **NOTE :** When using the WRC 537 method, if _Yes_ has been selected in the _Use \(MAX\) curve_ menu, the software will if its able use the values from the normal curve when outside the MAX curve limits.  
Full radiography reqd | The shell thickness exceeds 1.5" and full radiography has not been specified - see UW-11\(a\)\(2\).  
_Low temperature_ | Further analysis per UCS-66 may be required - see [Limitations](<h9996.htm#0700>).  
Nozzle strength ratio | The membrane stress in the nozzle neck due to pressure and external loads exceeds the allowable design stress.  
_Pad OD_ | The pad width is less than the PD 5500 recommended minimum for pressure considerations. Further checks may be necessary.  
_Radial_ | For local load calculations the nozzle is considered to be Radial.  
Ratio dm/Dm | The ratio _d_ m / _D_ m \(_r_ o / _R m_ for solid attachment, _r_ m / _R m_ for nozzles\) is greater than 1/3. The shallow shell theory used in the method may not be valid - see WRC 107/537 Appendix A.2 and Fig. A-1.  
Ratio Dm/T | The ratio _D_ m / _T_ is less than 20.0 or less than \(4 + 16 _S_\), so the thin shell theory used is not considered to be valid - see WRC 107/537 Appendix A.2 and Fig. A-1.  
rm/t out of range | The ratio _Y = r_ m / _t_ is outside the range of one or more of the specific curves - see WRC 107/537 Fig. SP-1 to SP-10, and SM-1 to SM-10. The dimensionless membrane forces and bending moments at the limit value are used.  
Stress limit exceeded | One or more of the calculated stresses exceeds the corresponding allowable stress.  
T/t out of range |  The ratio _ρ = T / t_ is outside the range of one or more of the specific curves - see WRC 107/537 Fig. SP-1 to SP-10, and SM-1 to SM-10. The dimensionless membrane forces and bending moments at the limit value are used. Alternately, _T_ / _t_ exceeds the limits in Figure G.2.5-1   
Table values out of range | One or more of the parameters used in the Decock calculation are out of range.  
Thickness limit exceeded | The shell thickness exceeds the limit in TABLE UW-12 for the specified weld type.  
WRC 107 graphs | The dimensionless membrane forces and/or bending moments have been obtained by extrapolation in WRC 107 Fig. SP-1 to SP-10, or SM-1 to SM-10.
