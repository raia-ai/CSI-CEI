# NozzlePRO FEA Analysis
Finglow now has the capability to run an FEA analysis on a nozzle or a saddle support using NozzlePRO.
The button will only be available when a calculation has successfully been performed using Finglow.
**NOTE:** The calculation cannot be performed without NozzlePRO being installed. See - NozzlePRO pathname
The calculation may take upto 5 minutes to run depending on its complexity, once selected the software may ask for any extra data that is not included in the Finglow calculation, this data must be input for the analysis to run correctly.
