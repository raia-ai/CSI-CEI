# PD 5500 - U-Tube Tubesheets
* * *
# Program Capabilities
The program can analyse the effects of pressure on U-tube tubesheet exchangers, generally in accordance with PD 5500 Section 3.9.
The exchanger comprises a shell, a tube bundle and one tubesheet.
The program has a Design Option to determine the minimum required thickness of the tubesheet.
Code limitations are checked in accordance with PD 5500 Section 3.9\(f\) & \(g\).
* * *
# Operation
The program analyses the following:- 
  * Tubes: Tensile and compressive longitudinal stresses due to pressure and tubesheet support. Circumferential membrane stress due to pressure, tubes are not checked for collapse due to external pressure.  
  * Tubesheet: Bending and shear stresses due to pressure and additionally edge bending due to bolting, if applicable.  
  * Tube/Tubesheet joints: Tube end loads due to pressure and tubesheet support.
Examples of various exchanger configurations are detailed in the diagrams below - see [Channel-TS-Shell Connections](<h9989.htm#0100>).

## Design Conditions
The program can process five conditions simultaneously. Additional conditions can be handled by repeated use of the program. The type of condition under consideration may be specified as new or corroded, design or test:
_New:Des_   
_Cor:Des_   
_New:Tst_   
_Cor:Tst_   
The program does not consider differential design conditions which will require agreement between the Manufacturer and the End User.
## Tube End Types
Tube end types may be specified as:
| _Strength weld_ | _PD 5500 Table 3.9-2 Type a_  
---|---|---  
| _Seal weld_ | _PD 5500 Table 3.9-2 Type b_

| _Explosion bonded_ | _PD 5500 Table 3.9-2 Type f_  
For expanded tube ends, the number of tube hole grooves may be specified as: _None, Single_ or _Double_ that is 2 or more.
## Corrosion
Corrosion allowances may be specified for both internal and external surfaces of the shell and channel, as required.
Corrosion allowances for the tubesheet are separately specified for the shellside and the tubeside.
For new or as built conditions any input corrosion allowances will be ignored.
NOTE: Corrosion is not applied to tube surfaces, as these are normally considered as consumables. If corrosion is required then the corroded tube dimensions should be input.
