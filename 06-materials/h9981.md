# Rotate Loads
The software has the ability to rotate Piping loads so they are normal to the shell surface. Enter the Piping loads and the given rotations in the Z, Y or Z axis and the program will rotate/normalise them. 
## Loadings and Sign Convention Shells
All loadings are assumed to act through a point on the centre-line of the nozzle or attachment, either at the surface of the shell or at a particular standout, as specified by the user. The X, Y and Z axes are defined as follows: 
  * X axis - The longitudinal axis parallel to the centre-line of the shell, positive in the direction from end location 2 to end location 1.  
  * Y axis - The axis tangential to the shell in the circumferential direction, positive in the direction 90° anti-clockwise from the X axis when looking towards the centre of the shell.  
  * Z axis - The radial axis normal to the surface of the shell, positive in the direction outwards from the centre of the shell.

The following loadings may be specified for any type of attachment: 
  * Load X \(long shear\) - A longitudinal shear load acting in the direction of the X axis.  
  * Load Y \(circ shear\) - A circumferential shear load acting in the direction of the Y axis.  
  * Load Z \(radial\) - A radial load acting in the direction of the Z axis.  
  * Moment X \(circ\) - A circumferential bending moment acting about the X axis.  
  * Moment Y \(long\) - A longitudinal bending moment acting about the Y axis.  
  * Moment Z \(torsion\) - A torsional moment acting about the Z axis.
All loads and moments may be specified as positive or negative. A positive load acts in the direction of the relevant axis as shown in the diagram above. A positive moment acts about the relevant axis using the right hand screw rule.
## Loadings and Sign Convention Heads
All loadings are assumed to act through a point on the centre-line of the nozzle or attachment, either at the surface of the head or at a particular standout, as specified by the user. The X, Y and Z axes are defined as follows: 
  * X axis - The reference axis tangential to the head. Normally this will correspond to the direction of zero orientation.  
  * Y axis - The axis tangential to the head, positive in the direction 90° anti-clockwise from the X axis when looking towards the centre of the head.  
  * Z axis - The radial axis normal to the surface of the head, positive in the direction outwards from the centre of the head.

The following loadings may be specified for any type of attachment: 
  * Load X \(shear\) - A shear load acting in the direction of the X axis.  
  * Load Y \(shear\) - A shear load acting in the direction of the Y axis.  
  * Load Z \(radial\) - A radial load acting in the direction of the Z axis.  
  * Moment X - A bending moment acting about the X axis.  
  * Moment Y - A bending moment acting about the Y axis.  
  * Moment Z - A torsional moment acting about the Z axis.
All loads and moments may be specified as positive or negative. A positive load acts in the direction of the relevant axis as shown in the diagram above. A positive moment acts about the relevant axis using the right hand screw rule.
## Rotation of Axes Example
The program includes a facility for converting the loading data from any arbitrary set of axes to those defined in Loadings and Sign Convention Shells or Loadings and Sign Convention Heads. This is achieved by rotation about each axis as required. The operation of this facility is best explained by means of a worked example.

Consider a nozzle in a vertical vessel. The loadings are specified for a set of axes where the X axis is vertical \(positive upwards\), the Y axis is at 30° to the face of the flange on the nozzle and the Z axis is at 30° to the centre-line of the nozzle . The following loadings are given:
Load X  | 1000  
---|---  
Load Y | 2000  
Load Z | 3000  
Moment X  | 400000  
Moment Y | 500000  
Moment Z | 600000  
The loading data should be entered as shown above
The Rotation is entered as -30 in the X axis as this is the one axis that coincides with that required by the program. The angle is negative because the rotation is opposite to the positive direction for moment X.
When the calculation is performed the program will convert the loads and moments as follows:
Load Y | = | 2000cos30° - 3000sin30° |  |   
---|---|---|---|---  
| = | 1732.05 - 1500.0 | = | 232.05  
Load Z | = | 3000cos30° + 2000sin30° |  |   
| = | 2598.08 + 1000.0 | = | 3598.08  
Moment Y | = | 500000cos30° - 600000sin30° |  |   
| = | 433013 - 300000 | = | 133013.00  
Moment Z | = | 600000cos30° + 500000sin30° |  |   
| = | 519615 + 250000 | = | 769615.00
