# ASME VIII Div.2 - Nozzles & Openings
# Single or Combined Reinforcement
* * *
# Program Capabilities
This program performs the calculations for the reinforcement requirements of single or combined nozzles or openings, either integrally reinforced or fitted with single-sided or double-sided reinforcing pads, in accordance with ASME VIII Div.2 section 4.5. The minimum requirements for attachment welds are assessed in accordance with section 4.2.
All shell and head types may be specified by either inside or outside diameter. Nozzles may be specified by nominal bore, inside diameter or outside diameter. All thicknesses are entered in the new or as built condition. Thinning allowance may be specified for the shell and the nozzles, either as a percentage of the new thickness or as an absolute value in mm or inches. Thinning allowances are always applied to the inside surface. Both internal and external corrosion allowances may be specified as required.
NOTE: This program does not currently cater for Nozzles and Openings under External Pressure.

# Operation
## Nozzles and Openings
### Nozzle Types
The basic types of nozzles and openings covered by the program are shown in [Nozzle Types](<h9993.htm#0500>).
Double pad and Pad types are not currently supported.
### Nozzle Configuration & Location
The types of nozzle configurations covered by the program are shown in [Nozzle Configuration & Location](<h9993.htm#0100>) .
### Nozzle Dimensions
External and internal projections are measured along the centre-line of the nozzle from the nozzle reference point. For oblique or offset nozzles the program will check that the external projection on the shorter side is sufficient to clear the outside surface of the shell or pad.
For nozzles with single-sided or double-sided pads in cylindrical and conical shells, the pad outside diameter is measured in the longitudinal direction parallel to the surface of the vessel. For nozzles with pads in dished heads the pad diameter is measured parallel to the vessel wall at the midsurface of the pad thickness. The pad width from the outside surface of the nozzle to the outer edge of the pad is assumed to be constant. For Pad type openings the outside diameter of the pad is measured perpendicular to the centre-line of the opening.
## Nozzle Reinforcement
The requirements for reinforcement of single nozzles or openings in cylindrical or conical shells are calculated for one plane which is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the vessel.
The requirements for reinforcement of single nozzles or openings in dished heads are calculated for one plane through the centre of the head and the centre of the nozzle.
The cross-section areas available for reinforcement in the shell, nozzle, pads and welds, and which are contained within the limits of reinforcement are calculated.
The limits of reinforcement are calculated in accordance with Section 4.5 and are measured as follows: 
  * _Reinf limit LR_ \- measured parallel to the vessel wall from the centre of the nozzle or opening.  
  * _Reinf limit LH_ \- measured parallel to the centre-line of the nozzle from the corroded outside surface of the vessel.  
  * _Reinf limit LI_ \- measured parallel to the centre-line of the nozzle from the corroded inside surface of the vessel.
See [Limits of Reinforcement](<h9993.htm#0600>).
The limits of reinforcement in the nozzle are checked against the external and internal projections. If the limits of reinforcement extend beyond these physical limits then the area available will be limited to that within the physical limits.
When an internal projection is specified the nominal nozzle wall thickness less twice the internal corrosion allowance is used when calculating the limit of reinforcement and the area available for reinforcement in the internal projection.
Different allowable stress values may be specified for the shell, nozzle and pads, and the program will calculate the appropriate values of strength reduction factors _f_ rn to _f_ r43.
## Combined Reinforcement
The Combined reinforcement option may be used to enable the reinforcement requirements of any two nozzles or openings to be calculated. Operation is the same as for the case of a single nozzle with the exception that input data for two nozzles is requested and additional calculations are performed for the reinforcement requirements.
The true pitch between the openings is calculated by the program at the midsurface of the corroded vessel wall, using the orientations and locations specified for each nozzle.
## Weld Sizes
The minimum requirements for attachment welds for nozzles and openings are checked in accordance with Section 4.2. The throat thickness of each weld, less the relevant corrosion allowance, is checked and a message produced if the weld size is too small.
Alternatively the user may select the _Size welds_ option. In this case the program will increase the input weld sizes as necessary to comply with section 4.2. The required minimum weld leg lengths will be rounded up to the nearest 1mm or 1/16" depending on the units selected. A message will be displayed to indicate that the weld sizes input were insufficient. The required weld sizes will be automatically entered into the input data so that when the Calculate option is selected again the calculations will be repeated with the correct weld sizes and the message will not be displayed.
Weld joint efficiency is determined from Table 7.2
## Test Conditions
Nozzles may be checked for the shop and/or site hydrostatic test conditions by setting the option _Check test case_ to _Yes_ \- see [Test Pressures](<h0598.htm#0200>).
If the design is not suitable for the test condition\(s\) appropriate warning messages will be produced. Detailed output data is not produced for the test conditions.
