# ASME VIII Div.1 - Floating Head Covers & Rings
* * *
# Program Capabilities
This program performs the calculations for spherically domed and bolted ends of the form shown in Figure 1-6, subject to internal and external pressure, in accordance with ASME VIII Div.1 Appendix 1-6. The bolting area required, the bolt loads and the gasket width check are calculated in accordance with Appendix 2. For narrow-faced flanges the gasket contact face must be entirely within the circle enclosed by the bolts.
NOTE: The program does not cover full-faced flanges with metal-to-metal contact outside the bolt circle.
Backing rings may also be specified per TEMA RCB-5.1.4.1, Style A or B. They can be specified as one of two types, a normal split backing ring, or a split keyed type backing ring. The outside diameter of the backing ring is taken as the flange outside diameter.
Bolting data for standard metric and inch series bolts is provided by the program. Clearances are based on TEMA TABLE D-5 - see [\[26\]](<h9998.htm#0026>).
Dependent on the [Bolt tightening method](<h9997.htm#0400>) selected, pre determined bolt loads can be applied. 
All thicknesses are entered in the new or as built condition, except as noted see Backing Ring Flange Types. Both tubeside and shellside corrosion allowances may be specified as required - see Corrosion.
The cover to which the flange is fitted is specified by the inside spherical radius. A thinning allowance may be specified either as a percentage of the new thickness or as an absolute value in mm or inches. The thinning allowance is always applied to the inside surface.

# Operation
## Joint Efficiency
For the purposes of assessing the stresses, no account is taken of joint efficiencies and _E_ is assumed to be 1.0. Any variation of _E_ should be entered by adjusting the value of allowable stress.
## Spherically Domed and Bolted End
This type of domed and bolted end is designed by treating the domed end and the bolted flange as two separate components in compliance with the relevant clauses in 1-6. The flange is attached to the cover by a full penetration weld. Corrosion is deducted from the flange and the cover as indicated in the diagram below. NOTE: The maximum of the shellside and tubeside corrosion allowance will be deducted from the bore irrespective of the location of the cover.

## Facing types
Although no specific flange facing types are defined in BS5500, there are various facing types available in the program which correspond to those commonly used for bolted flanged connections - see [Facing & Gasket Data](<h9985.htm>).
## Backing Ring Flange Types
Corrosion allowances are not deducted from backing ring flanges as these components are generally considered disposable, hence corroded dimensions should be entered if a corrosion allowance is required.
### Normal Backing Ring
See TEMA RCB-5.1.4.1 Style B.
### Keyed Backing Ring
See TEMA RCB-5.1.4.1 Style A.
![](..\\img\\keyedbr.png)
NB: The software does not check the thickness at the base of the groove in the tubesheet. This should be greater than the value _t 1._
## Gaskets & Facings
See [Gaskets & Facings](<h0198.htm#0550>). 
## Bolting
See [Bolting](<h0198.htm#0600>) and [Bolting Data](<h9984.htm>). 
## Corrosion
Both tubeside and shellside corrosion allowances may be specified as required. The corrosion allowances are applied to the tubeside and shellside surfaces of the flange, cover and tubesheet as shown in Spherically Domed and Bolted End and Keyed Backing Ring. Corrosion allowance is not deducted from the gasket seating face of the flange or backing ring.
## Test conditions
See [Test Pressures](<h0198.htm#0200>) for the calculation of the allowable stresses and loads in the test conditions.
NOTE: The test pressure condition considers only the flange material. The bolting or dished cover may govern the test case and should be considered separately.
## Calculations
### Bolt Loads
Bolt loads _W_ m1 and _W_ m2 are calculated for the operating and bolting-up conditions respectively, in accordance with Appendix 2-5.
### Flange Moments
Moments are calculated for the operating and bolting-up conditions generally in accordance with Appendix 2-6, 2-11 or 2-13 as appropriate.
### Flange Factors
The flange factor _Y_ is evaluated using the equation given on Figure 2-7.1.
