# Load data
Load data can be attached to a _Nozzle_ \(i.e inserted after the _Circumferential Weld_ or _Flange_ attached to the nozzle\) or an _Attachment_ and is considered to be a local load, the software would produce a calculation for either _Local loads on heads_ or _Local loads on shells_.
Description | Enter the load description.  
---|---  
Constant load | Select _Yes_ for calculation of stresses using specified loads and moments, or _No_ for calculations taking account of the flexibility of the piping or loading system fixed to the nozzle or attachment - see [Pipe and Shell Flexibility](<h9997.htm#0900>).  
Pressure load | For Openings, select _Yes_ to add the calculated radial pressure end load to the value of _Load Z_ input - see [Pressure Load](<h9997.htm#0450>)  
At shell surface | Select _Yes_ if the specified loads act at the surface of the shell/head or _No_ if the loads act at a distance away from the surface \(e.g. at the face of the flange on a nozzle\). The standout will be calculated by the software. NOTE For Load Data acting on an [Attachment](<h9000.htm>), this menu will be displayed, but will be set by the program depending on any standout being entered in the [Attachment data](<h9124.htm>) screen.  
Deflection Dz | The deflection that would occur in the Z direction if the nozzle or attachment were completely free to move in this direction. The sign of the Free end defl _D_ z must be the same as that of the Load Z \(radial\).  
Rotation Ry | The rotation that would occur about the Y axis if the nozzle or attachment were completely free to rotate about this axis. The sign of the Free end rotn _R_ y must be the same as that of the Moment Y \(long\).  
Rotation Rx | The rotation that would occur about the X axis if the nozzle or attachment were completely free to rotate about this axis. The sign of the Free end rotn _R_ x must be the same as that of the Moment X \(circ\).  
X Axis | Enter the requied angle of rotation in the X axis. NOTE this my be left as zero if no rotation is required - see [Rotate Loads](<h9981.htm>).  
Y Axis | Enter the requied angle of rotation in the Y axis. NOTE this my be left as zero if no rotation is required - see [Rotate Loads](<h9981.htm>).  
Z Axis | Enter the requied angle of rotation in the Z axis. NOTE this my be left as zero if no rotation is required - see [Rotate Loads](<h9981.htm>).  
## Additional Information
NOTE: The direction of Moment My is +ve as shown based on the locations assumed by the software, this is important when the Nozzle/Attachment is not centrally located on the vessel.
