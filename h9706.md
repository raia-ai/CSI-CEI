# Data Sheet Screen

## Entering Data
Unlike the other Finglow modules, the _Data Sheet/Manual Calcs_ module requires an input file to be read before any data can be entered. Select the [Read Input](<h9801.htm#0100>) option from the File menu.
For each field the field type will be displayed on the [EFP Status Bar](<h9707.htm>) at the bottom of the screen; either _Alpha Field_ , _Input Field_ or _Output Field_.
As well as the message _S:snum/E:enum/F:fnum_. _S_ , _E_ and _F_ refer to the Screen, Equation and Function files and _snum_ , _enum_ and _fnum_ are the corresponding index numbers for those files and denote which files have been linked together to produce the input file selected.
  * Alpha Fields - These may contain any printable character including numbers, spaces and punctuation symbols.  
  * Input Fields - These may contain numbers, the + or - sign and a decimal point.  
  * Output Fields - These will contain the results of the calculation when the Calculate option has been selected. The number of decimal places to be displayed in each Output Field is determined by entering a decimal point followed by zeros, the number of zeros representing the number of decimal places required.
If a table has been set up in the screen file, then the field background colour will be yellow. Table lines can be duplicated or deleted first selecting a field on the table line, this will cause two buttons to appear on the right hand side of the screen these buttons are ![](..\\img\\plus1.png) and ![](..\\img\\minus1.png).
Pressing the ![](..\\img\\plus1.png) button will reproduce a copy of the current table line on the line below, shifting any subsequent lines one line down. If the screen file is full this button will be grayed. In this event, redesign the screen file or reduce the number of table lines. Press the ![](..\\img\\minus1.png) button to delete the current line and move any subsequent lines one line up.
## Calculate
Press the ![](..\\img\\calc.png) button and the screen below will be displayed, this performs the calculations in accordance with the specified Equations and Functions and will insert the calculated values into the Output Fields.

NOTE : The program must interpret and evaluate each equation in the calculation, so there will be a short delay while the calculations are being performed. The length of this delay will depend on the complexity of the calculations and the processing speed of the computer. The facility is available to include messages in the equations which will be displayed on the screen as that equation is actioned. This is useful in long programs as an indication of the progress of the calculation.
When the calculations have been completed the message _Calculation_ _Complete_ will appear on the screen.
