# ASME VIII Div.2 - Fixed Tubesheets
* * *
# Program Capabilities
The program can analyse the effects of pressure and differential thermal expansion on a fixed tubesheet exchanger, generally in accordance with ASME VIII Div.2 Section 4.18.
Tube end loads are calculated in accordance with ASME VIII Div.2 4.21. NOTE the calculation does not take account of any radial differential thermal expansion at the tube-to-tubesheet joint.
The design of tube-to-tubesheet welds is not included.
The exchanger comprises a shell, optionally fitted with a shell expansion bellows, a tube bundle and two equal tubesheets. Channels are considered to be cylindrical.
The program has a Design Option to determine the minimum required thickness of the tubesheet.
Note that dimensional requirements should be manually checked for compliance with TEMA.
Note that the joint efficiency _E_ is assumed equal to 1 for shells and tubes.
Additionally the software has the capability to perform calculations to TEMA RCB-8 Flexible Shell Elements. Note that only single convolutions are taken into account.
* * *
# Operation
The program analyses the following: 
* Shell: Tensile and compressive longitudinal stresses due to pressure and differential thermal expansion. The circumferential joint efficiency _E s,w_ is assumed to be 1.0. Circumferential stress due to pressure. Note: the External Pressure module should be used for a full analysis of shells subject to external pressure.  
* Tubes: Tensile and compressive longitudinal stresses due to pressure and thermal expansion. Circumferential membrane stress due to pressure, tubes are not checked for collapse due to external pressure.  
* Tubesheet: For TEMA bending and shear stresses due to pressure and thermal expansion, additionally edge bending due to bolting, if applicable or bending stresses for 4.18.8.  
* Tube/Tubesheet joints: Pull out loads due to pressure and thermal expansion.
The program does not consider differential design conditions which will require agreement between the Manufacturer and the End User.
Examples of various exchanger configurations are detailed in the diagrams below - see [Channel-TS-Shell Connections](<h9989.htm#0100>).

## Design Conditions
The program can handle five design conditions simultaneously. Additional conditions can be handled by repeated use of the program. The type of condition under consideration may be specified as new or corroded, design or test:
_New:Des_  
_Cor:Des_  
_New:Tst_  
_Cor:Tst_  
The program does not consider differential design conditions which will require agreement between the Manufacturer and the End User.
## Tube End Types
See [Tube End Types](<h0598.htm#1500>)
## Metal Temperatures
See [Metal Temperatures](<h9997.htm#0800>).
## Corrosion
Corrosion allowances may be specified for both internal and external surfaces of the shell and channel, as required.
Corrosion allowances for the tubesheet may be specified for the shellside and the tubeside.
For new or as built conditions any input corrosion allowances will be ignored.
NOTE: Corrosion is not applied to tube surfaces, as these are normally considered as consumables. If corrosion is required then the corroded tube dimensions should be input.
## Joint Efficiency
For the purposes of assessing the stresses, no account is taken of joint efficiencies and _E_ is assumed to be 1.0. Any variation of _E_ should be entered by adjusting the value of allowable stress.
## Test conditions
See [Test Pressures](<h0598.htm#0200>) for the calculation of the allowable stresses and loads in the test conditions.
## Gaskets & Facings

# System Messages
## Warning and Advisory Messages
Messages printed below in _italics_ are not considered to be critical - see [Warnings Messages](<h9997.htm#0501>).
_Acceptable calculation_ | The calculations have been performed successfully.  
---|---  
_Bolt circle : max_ |  The bolt circle diameter is too large to comply with the recommended bolt clearances. The value displayed shows the recommended maximum.   
_Bolt circle : min_ |  The bolt circle diameter is too small to comply with the recommended bolt clearances. The value displayed shows the recommended minimum.   
Bolt stress | The bolt stress limit has been exceeded.  
_Bolt tensioning recommended_ |  The nominal bolt diameter exceeds 38 mm - see PD 5500 3.8.1.4, or the _Probable wrench load_ predicted by ASME VIII, Div.1 Nonmandatory Appendix S is less than the actual bolt load. The use of bolt tensioning or torque tightening equipment is recommended.   
_Bolt tightening controlled_ |  The bolt stress has exceeded the nominal code limit but may be acceptable for controlled bolt tightening if agreed between the designer, manufacturer and inspection authority. See also, ASME VIII, Div.1 Nonmandatory Appendix S.   
Buckling length kl  | The tube buckling stress exceeds the allowable.  
Code limitations exceeded | One or more of the limitations specified in ASME VIII Div.2 for the component have been exceeded. Use of the _Shells - Internal Pressure_ module will give detailed warning messages.  
Compressive stress | A combination of compressive stress limits the calculation - see 4.4.12.  
_Contact width N\(min\)_ | The gasket width _N_ is less than the minimum recommended in Taylor Forge Modern Flange Design to avoid possible crushing during bolting-up - see [Gaskets & Facings](<h0598.htm#0500>).  
_Dissimilar materials_ | The design strength of the tubesheet is less than the design strength of the attached shell/channel.  
_Elastic plastic_ | The effects of plasticity have been taken into account at the tubesheet/channel/shell junction as per 4.18.8.6.   
Extrapolated graphs/tables | The value of factor μ _\*_ is greater than 0.6 or less than 0.1 - see Tables 4.18.1 and 4.18.2. NOTE: The limit values have been used.  
FSE Calculation | A warning has been gererated when performing the FSE calculation. A description of this warning will be displayed at the end of the warnings list.  
_Hole dia_ | The tube hole is more than 4% larger than the tube outside diameter. Acceptable for tubesheets with inserts.  
_Hole quantity_ | It is not possible to fit the quantity of tube holes entered. The software will display the maximum number of holes that can fit into the specified outer tube limit.  
Insufficient bolting | The total required bolt cross-sectional area _A_ m is greater than the actual cross-sectional area _A_ b.  
_Insufficient pre-load_ | The specified bolt pre-load input is less than the design load required.  
_Low temperature_ | Further analysis per 4.1.5 may be required - see [Limitations](<h9996.htm#0700>).  
_Max pressure_ | The pressure limit has been exceeded - see 1.2.2.2.  
_Min bolt dia_ | The nominal bolt diameter is less than the recommended minimum of 1/2" - see 4.16.4.  
Min reqd edge thk  | The required thickness for edge bending exceeds that available.  
_Minimum pitch_ | The tube pitch is less than the recommended value of 1.25 times the tube OD.  
Shell length | The minimum required shell length per 4.18.8.5 has not been met. The minimum required value is displayed.   
Stress limit exceeded  | A calculated value of bending, membrane or shear stress exceeds the allowable.  
Tube end  | The tube end load exceeds the allowable pull out load.  
Tubesheet thk h | The Tubesheet thickness is less than the tube outside diameter - see footnote to 4.18.3  
## Fatal Warning Messages
See [Fatal Messages](<h9997.htm#0502>).
Basic seating width b'o | For a full-faced flange the gasket width does not straddle the bolt circle diameter.  
---|---  
Condition  | The number of conditions on each multi-column input page are not equal, the same number of design conditions are required.  
Configuration not permitted  | The _Channel-TS-Shell type_ is not supported by Figure 4.18.5.  
Corroded failure  | A component thickness is less than the corrosion allowance specified.  
Design | The program was unable to calculate a tubesheet thickness to satisfy the tubesheet and tube bundle calculation. It may be that an expansion bellows is required or alternative tube end types are needed.  
Dia and/or thk invalid  | A diameter and/or thickness is zero or the thickness exceeds the radius.  
DT stress > ATM stress  | Material properties at the design temperature exceed those at room temperature.  
Facing configuration mis-match | The facing configuration of the mating flange is incompatible with the tubesheet.  
Gasket | The Gasket Material and Gasket Type combination is invalid - see [Gasket types](<h9985.htm#0300>).  
Gasket/Calc method | The gasket selection is incompatible with the calculation method.  
Hemispherical head | A Hemispherical head must be specified for a welded channel as per Figure 4.18.15\(b\).  
Input  | An item of input data has not been entered or is outside of its expected range, for example: 
* Gasket diameter is less than the outer tube limit. 
* Length over tubesheets is less than twice the tubesheet thickness. 
* Tube outside diameter greater than hole diameter.   
Insufficient thk | The shell, tube or channel thickness is insufficient for internal pressure.  
Invalid data | A combination of input data is invalid or inconsistent.  
Material | There has been an error getting data from the [Material Database](<h9996.htm>), a more detailed explanation of this error will displayed on the Material Dialog box of the specific material.
