# Material Database
## Group Number
All materials are classified by group. The group number is based on PD CEN ISO/TR 15608:2013 _Welding - Guidelines for a metallic material grouping system_ [\[32\]](<h9998.htm#0032>) and further subdivided to enable the incorporation of different ASME VIII, Div.1 External pressure charts or other minor material differences.
## Select by Specification
From the following screen the user can select the required material specification. The software will then determine all relevant material properties from the Material Database.
The list can be sorted by clicking on the required column header. The required material can also be found by typing its specification or by clicking on the list of recently selected materials.

## Data Source
The Design Code related data source are displayed in the Data source list box on the above screen by selecting the required Design Code. This information will also appear on the printout.
To display the actual data, highlight the source line and click on the _View data_ button. The relevant source data will be displayed, as shown below.
![](..\\img\\matdisp.png)
Some of the Data source\(s\) use abbreviations as follows:
  * : without SETs - a calculation has been performed using material data without Specified Elevated Temperature values.
  * : SETs verified - a calculation has been performed using material data with Verified Specified Elevated Temperature values.
  * : SETs unverified - a calculation has been performed using material data with Unverified Specified Elevated Temperature values.
The Material properties, Material No, Product form, Material Group number and the data source will be printed on the calculation output.

## Error messages
Any error messages encountered retrieving data will be displayed alongside the appropriate data source, the text will also be displayed in red.

The messages will be one of the following.
  * Temperature limit exceeded - Material data table limits exceeded  
  * Thickness limit exceeded - Material data table limits exceeded.  
  * Diameter limit exceeded - Material data table limits exceeded.  
  * Data unavailable - Requested data for this material is not available.  
  * Material invalid - Material data types do not match. e.g. a material specification of tube product form has been selected for a flange material.  
  * Invalid Group No. - Requested data for this material Group is not available.  
  * Installation error - Contact your IT department.

## Select by Group - Finglow 2D
If a user wishes to input their own stress or yield data then click the **_Group_** tab and select the applicable material type. The software will determine expansion, elastic and other relevant material properties from the Material Database.

## User defined - Finglow 2D
Clicking the **_User defined_** tab will require the user to input all material data with the exception of metal specific gravity, Poissons ratio and the applicable ASME VIII, Div.1 External pressure chart data.

## Select by Group - Finglow 3D
If a user wishes to input their own stress or yield data then click the **_Group_** tab and select the applicable material type. The software will determine expansion, elastic and other relevant material properties from the Material Database.

## User defined - Finglow 3D
Clicking the **_User defined_** tab will require the user to input all material data with the exception of metal specific gravity, Poissons ratio and the applicable ASME VIII, Div.1 External pressure chart data.

## Limitations
Time dependent material properties are not included in the database, the user should employ the _User defined_ material option for these. 
Low temperature properties, such as ductility, are not checked by the software. The software considers low temperature to be a design temperature less than room temperature. The applicable Code may have more stringent requirements. 
Data source selection, especially for generic properties such as elastic modulus and expansion properties, can be subjective. The user should ensure that the source selection chosen by the software, especially when using material sources across Codes, is suitable for the particular design conditions and component being assessed. 
When in doubt the user should employ the _User defined_ material option.
