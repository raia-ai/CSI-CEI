# Program Capabilities
The Finglow Data Sheet and Engineering Formula Processor program is used to run pre-created Calculation or Data sheets. This option can be used in two different ways.
  1. It can be used to create completely user defined Data Sheets. These sheets can be set up by the user to reflect the standard layouts required for different items of process equipment.  
  2. The Engineering Formula Processor \(EFP\) provides data sheets with a highly comprehensive calculation capability enabling users to program their own Manual Calculation Sheets.
Both data sheets and calculation sheets can be printed along with any other Finglow Software output by using the Format Design Report option.
See also [Importing EFP Sheets](<h9708.htm>) and Convert SEF files.

# Operation
Operation of this module is the same as the other Engineering.
At this point the main difference between this and other modules is that no data will be loaded automatically into the computer's memory when the Data Sheet program is first accessed.
NOTE : All Systems are able to use this module in conjunction with any of the standard sheets issued by Finglow. However, the ability to create new Data and/or Calculation Sheets using the [EFP Editor](<h9703.htm>) is an optional extra.
## Toolbar
The toolbar is displayed across the top of the application window, below the menu bar. The toolbar provides quick mouse access to many tools used in Finglow Software,
![](..\\img\\fileefpnew.png) | Read a new sheet. Finglow Software displays the Read new link file dialog box, in which to locate and open the desired Link file - see Read new sheet.  
---|---  
![](..\\img\\fileread.png) | Read an existing input file. Finglow Software displays the Read Input dialog box, in which to locate and open the desired Input file.  
![](..\\img\\filesave.png) | Save the currently entered data as an input file. Finglow Software displays the Save Input dialog box, in which to overwrite an existing input file or create a new one.  
![](..\\img\\fileout.png) | Save the complete calculation for later printing in report format using the Format Design Report option. Finglow Software displays the Save Output dialog box, in which to overwrite an existing output file or create a new one.  
![](..\\img\\fileprnt.png) | Send a copy of the current calculation only to the printer.  
![](..\\img\\calc.png) | Perform the relevant calculations based on the design data entered.  
![](..\\img\\linkicon.png) | Allows the user to link screens together unsing [EFP Linker](<h9704.htm>).  
![](..\\img\\efpviewtog.png) | This button will toggle between the [Data Sheet Screen](<h9706.htm>) and the [EFP Editor Screen](<h9703.htm>).  
![](..\\img\\plus1.png) | This button will make a copy of the current table line.  
![](..\\img\\minus1.png) | This button will delete the current table line.  
![](..\\img\\hlpbtn.png) | Contextual Help \(Shortcut F1\).

## Convert SEF files
Files created prior to 2020 sofware release need to be converted to the new format. From the **File** menu select **Convert SEF files** , the dialog shown below will then be displayed.
![](..\\img\\FlatFileConvefp.png)
There are two different ways the software can display the users data - see [Folders or Drives view](<h9808.htm#0200>)
To find existing **SEF File\(s\)** navigate using either view. The files will be at the top level in the existing **DTA** folder. If the **DTA** folder contains any **SEF file\(s\)** the **Convert SEF files** button at the bottom of the screen will become live.
NOTE: This will only have to be done once.

## Read new sheet
When a new _Link file template_ has been saved using the [EFP Linker](<h9704.htm>), or has been Imported using [Import EFP file](<h9808.htm#0500>), the user can read this new _Link file template_ , then edit data as normal and save the input file using the standard [Save Input](<h9801.htm#0200>).
