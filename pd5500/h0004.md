# PD 5500 - Saddle & Ring Supports

## PD 5500 - Saddle & Ring Supports

***

## Program Capabilities

This program performs the calculations for the stresses in cylindrical horizontal vessels supported on two symmetrically located saddles in accordance with PD 5500 Annex G.3.3 with reference to BSI document PD 6497 ref. [\[15\]](../h9998.htm#0015). See [External Loads on Horizontal Vessels](../h0013.htm) for asymmetrically located saddles or vessels with additional external loads. The maximum allowable longitudinal compressive stress for the shell can be calculated in accordance with Annex A.3.5, A.3.5.1.3 _Alternative limits based upon ECCS rules_ or _Enquiry Case 5500/141_. The program calculates the internal volume of the shell and heads in the uncorroded condition, and hence the weight of the liquid contents for a specified liquid level and specific gravity. The membrane stresses due to internal and external pressure are also calculated. The calculation of stresses in ring supports under external pressure per PD 5500 clause G.3.3.4 are outside the scope of this module. See PD 5500 clause G.3.3.2.8 for the calculation of stresses for fatigue loading. NOTE: For low temperature designs PD 5500 Annex D limits the use of certain types of saddles welded to the shell. These limitations are not checked.

## Operation

### Support Types

The following types of support are covered by the program: [Plain saddle](../h9988.htm#0010).\
[Internal ring](../h9988.htm#0020).\
[External ring](../h9988.htm#0020).\
[Adjacent internal rings](../h9988.htm#0030).\
[Adjacent external rings](../h9988.htm#0030).\
[Ring support](../h9988.htm#0040). All support types may be welded to the shell or loose, except ring supports which are assumed to be welded. Saddle angles from 30° to 180° are permitted by the program, but it should be noted that Annex G.3.3.2 states that the included angle of a saddle support should normally be in the range 120° to 150°. Saddles outside this range would require careful consideration. This requirement is checked by the program.

### Cylindrical Shell

The membrane stresses due to pressure are calculated using thin shell theory - see Annex G.3.3.2.3.

### Dished Heads

It is usual for the head to be of the same material as the shell, and this is the assumption that the software makes. If the design stress for the head material is less than the shell a separate manual check of calculated stress will be required.

#### Ellipsoidal Heads

The stress due to pressure _f n(d)_ is calculated by the following procedure: The external head height _h_ e, external diameter _D_ and actual head thickness _e_ are evaluated in the corroded condition. The ratios _h_ e / _D_ and _e / D_ are calculated. The ratio _p_ / _f_ is determined from Table 3.5-2 using the calculated values of _h_ e / _D_ and _e / D_. The stress _f n(d)_ in the head is calculated as _p / (p / f),_ where _p_ is the internal pressure and _(p / f)_ is the value obtained from Table 3.5-2 - see Table G.3.3-2 Note 2.

#### Hemispherical Heads

The membrane stress due to pressure is calculated in accordance with 3.5.1.2(b), with equation (3.5.1-3) re-arranged to give the stress _f_.

#### Torispherical Heads

The external head height _h_ is calculated from the crown and knuckle radii, and the equivalent head height _h_ e is determined in accordance with 3.5.2.1. The stress due to pressure is calculated using the same procedure as for ellipsoidal heads.

### External Pressure

NOTE: No special analysis of the shell is performed by this module for vessels subject to external pressure. The program will calculate the compressive membrane stresses in the shell due to the external pressure. The shell must be separately checked for the external pressure condition using the External Pressure module. It should be noted that deformation of the shell adjacent to the saddles due to the weight of the vessel and its contents may exceed the permissible out-of-roundness specified in the NOTE in 3.6.2.1. Ring supports are preferable to saddle supports for vacuum vessels - see Annex G.3.3.1.

### Extended Wrapper Plates

If the calculated circumferential stresses in the shell are too high, then they can be reduced by fitting a wrapper plate or wear plate. The width of the wrapper plate should not be less than the saddle width _b_ 1 plus 10 times the shell thickness _t_ , and the wrapper plate must subtend an angle not less than the saddle angle θ plus 12° - see Annex G.3.3.2.6.2. If the wrapper plate angle exceeds 180° then the calculations will be performed for a wrapper plate angle of 180°. It is recommended that the wrapper plate is made the same thickness as the shell - see Annex G.3.3.2.6.2. If a wrapper plate is specified then the minimum required wrapper angle and width will be checked. If either the angle or the width is insufficient the wrapper will be ignored. If both the wrapper angle and width are sufficient then the relevant stresses are calculated in the wrapper at the edge of the saddle, using the combined shell and wrapper thickness, and also in the shell at the edge of the wrapper.

### Stiffening Rings

Additional stiffening of the shell may be provided by means of stiffening rings which may be positioned either externally or internally. The [Specification of Stiffening Rings](../h9990.htm) is the same as that for the _Shells - External Pressure_ module. The relevant corrosion allowance is deducted from all surfaces of stiffeners. NOTE: Wrapper plates, as detailed in Extended Wrapper Plates, are not considered to form part of any attached stiffening ring. When specifying internal or external rings adjacent to the saddles, it is assumed that there is a total of four rings, one either side of each saddle, and that all rings are of the same section. The information entered relates to one of the four identical rings. The distance between the stiffening rings adjacent to each saddle must be greater than the saddle width _b_ 1 plus 10 times the shell thickness _t_ , and less than the shell mean radius _r_ - see Annex G.3.3.2.6.3 and Figure G.3.3-8.

### Ring Type Supports

[Ring supports](../h9988.htm#0040) are used where it is important to ensure that the shell close to the supports remains round. This applies particularly to thin walled vessels which may distort excessively due to the weight of the vessel and contents, and to vessels subject to vacuum.

### Factors

Factors _K_ 1 to _K_ 11 are calculated in accordance with the equations in BSI Document PD 6497. When the saddle is welded to the shell the value of factor _K_ 5 is taken as one-tenth of the value from equation (34) in [\[15\]](../h9998.htm#0015) - see PD 5500 Annex G.3.3.2.6.2.

### Calculated and Allowable Stresses

#### Longitudinal Stresses

The longitudinal stresses are calculated at mid-span between the supports, _f_ 1 at the top of the shell from equation (G.3.3-5) and _f_ 2 at the bottom of the shell from equation (G.3.3-6). The longitudinal stress _f_ 3, at the supports is calculated at the top of the shell when the shell is stiffened by rings or by proximity of the ends (_A_ not greater than _r_ / 2), or near the equator when the shell is unstiffened, from equation (G.3.3-7). The longitudinal stress _f_ 4, at the supports is calculated at the bottom of the shell from equation (G.3.3-8). The longitudinal stresses _f_ 1 to _f_ 4 are calculated with both internal and external pressure. The maximum longitudinal compressive stresses are checked against an allowable longitudinal compressive stress of _Δsf_ in accordance with Annex A.3.5. If the design temperature does not exceed 350°C and the vessel is not under external pressure, then the value of _Δ_ is obtained from Figure A.2, otherwise _Δ_ is obtained from Figure 3.6-4 curve (b). The stresses _f_ 1 to _f_ 4 are combined with the circumferential pressure stress _σ θ_ and the radial pressure stress _σ z_ = -0.5 _p_ to give the total stress intensities. The stress intensities are checked against the design strength _f_.

#### Tangential Shearing Stresses

When the shell is not stiffened by the head (_A_ greater than _r_ / 2), the tangential shearing stress _q_ in the shell is calculated at the edge of the support from equation (G.3.3-9) when _L_ is greater than _(_ 4 _A +_ 4 _b_ /\_\_ 3 _)_ , i.e. when the shear force at the edge of the saddle closest to the mid-point of the vessel is the higher value. When _L_ is less than _(_ 4 _A +_ 4 _b_ / 3 _)_ the shear force at the edge of the saddle closest to the end of the vessel is the higher value, and the stress _q_ is calculated from equation (14) in [\[15\]](../h9998.htm#0015). Where the shell is considered to be stiffened by the dished head (_A_ not greater than _r /_ 2), the tangential shearing stress _q_ in the shell is calculated from equation (G.3.3-10) and the tangential shearing stress _q_ e in the head is calculated from equation (G.3.3-11). The allowable tangential shearing stress in the shell is the smaller of 0.8 _f_ or 0.06 _Et / r_. The tangential shearing stress in the head is checked against an allowable of (1.25 _f - pressure stress in head_).

#### Circumferential Stresses

For plain saddles and for rings adjacent to the saddle, circumferential stresses _f_ 5 are calculated from equation (G.3.3-17) at the bottom of the shell at the edge of the support and at the edge of the wrapper (when fitted). When the saddle is welded to the shell the circumferential stresses _f_ 5 are checked against the design strength _f_ , where _f_ is the smaller of the shell or wrapper plate design stress, otherwise _f_ 5 is checked against the smaller of strength _f_ or ε _E_ /3 as defined in G.3.3.2.6. The circumferential stresses _f_ 6 at the horn of the saddle, at the edge of the support and at the edge of the wrapper (when fitted), from the equations in G.3.3.2.6.2(a) or (b), and are checked in accordance with the rules in the each specific section. The circumferential stresses _f_ 7 in the shell and _f_ 8 in the flange or the tip of the ring remote from the shell are calculated at the horn of the saddle (for vessels with rings in the plane of the saddle) from equations in G.3.3.2.6.3(a) or (b), or near the equator (for rings adjacent to the saddle) from equations in G.3.3.2.6.3(c) or (d). These stresses are checked in accordance with the rules in the each specific section. For ring supports the maximum circumferential stress _f_ 10 in the ring is calculated from equation (G.3.3-38) and checked against the lower of _f_ or the stiffener design strength.

| _A > L/4 - b/3_             | The tanline to saddle centre distance _A_ exceeds the value (L/4 - b/3). The tangential shear stress _q_ , in the shell, is calculated from equation (14) in [\[15\]](../h9998.htm#0015). |
| Base plate stress           | Stress in the base plate exceeds the allowable.                                                                                                                                           |
| Bolt stress                 | Anchor bolt stress has exceeded the allowable.                                                                                                                                            |
| Code limitations exceeded   | One or more of the limitations specified in PD 5500 for the shell or head have been exceeded. Use of the _Shells - Internal Pressure_ module will give detailed warning messages.         |
| _Code recommends ring type_ | Ring supports are preferable for vessels subject to external pressure - see Annex G.3.3.1.                                                                                                |
| Concrete stress limit       | The concrete static stress has exceeded 5.5 N/mm2 or the maximum concrete induced stress has exceeded 7.5 N/mm2.                                                                          |
| _Distance between supports_ | For ring supported vessels the distance between supports is such that angle phi is less than 30°.                                                                                         |
