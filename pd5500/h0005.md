## PD 5500 - Local Loads on Cylinders

***

## Program Capabilities

This program performs the calculations for the assessment of stresses due to local loading on cylindrical shells in accordance with PD 5500 Annex G.2.3 or G.2.8 . The nomenclature used in the program output is generally in accordance with Annex G, except that the subscript _y_ is used in place of _φ_ and the subscript _t_ is used in place of _θ_ The stresses in the shell at the edge of a nozzle, solid attachment, reinforcing pad or insert plate are calculated to G.2.2 and G.2.3. The stresses due to internal pressure are calculated to G.2.3.6.2(a), (b) or (c). Shear stresses are calculated to G.2.3.6.3. The summation of stresses is in accordance with G.2.3.6.1. Allowable stresses are determined to Annex A. The deflections and rotations are evaluated in accordance with G.2.2.4 and G.2.3.5 or Enquiry Case 137 for hollow attachments. Nozzles may be specified by nominal bore, inside diameter or outside diameter. Thinning allowance may be specified for both the shell and the nozzles. The membrane stresses in the nozzle neck due the combined effect of pressure and external loads are checked by the program. The calculation method employed is described in PD 5500 Annex B. External moments and shear forces are combined vectorially as applicable. A warning message is displayed if the allowable design stress is exceeded. NOTE: The calculation method does not consider the effects of shear or torsional loads at the vessel surface.

## Operation

### Attachment Types

The following types of attachment are covered by the program:

* _Opening or nozzle_ - The following types of nozzles and openings may be selected - see [Nozzle Types](../h9993.htm#0500): _Plain nozzle_ _Nozzle + single pad_ _Nozzle + double pad_ _Self reinforced_ _Butt welded insert_ _Pad_
* _Solid circular_ - A circular attachment which does not penetrate the shell. The attachment itself may be hollow, as in the case of a lifting trunnion, but the stresses are calculated as if the attachment was solid.
* _Rectangular_ - A rectangular attachment. The attachment itself may be hollow, as in the case of a "box" type support bracket, but the stresses are calculated as if the attachment was solid.
* _Square_ - A square attachment (equal length and width). The attachment may be hollow as for the rectangular attachment.

### Loadings and Sign Convention

The following loadings may be specified for any type of attachment: see [Loadings and Sign Convention Shells](../h9981.htm#0010).

* Load X (long shear) - This corresponds to the load _F_ L in Figure G.2.3-4.
* Load Y (circ shear) - This corresponds to the load _F_ c in Figure G.2.3-4.
* Load Z (radial) - This corresponds to the load _F_ R in Figure G.2.3-4. The sign convention for the load _W_ in G.2.2 is opposite to that used for the radial load _F_ R - hence _W_ = -_F_ R.
* Moment X (circ) - This corresponds to the moment _M_ c in Figure G.2.3-4.
* Moment Y (long) - This corresponds to the moment _M_ L in Figure G.2.3-4.
* Moment Z (torsion) - This corresponds to the moment _M_ T in Figure G.2.3-4.

### Rotation of Axes

The program includes a facility for converting the loading data from any arbitrary set of axes to those defined in [Loadings and Sign Convention Shells](../h9981.htm#0010). This type of rotation is typically required for offset radial nozzles. This is achieved by rotation about each axis as required. The operation of this facility is explained in [Rotation of Axes Example](../h9981.htm#0030).

### Equivalent Length of Shell

If the nozzle or attachment is not located mid-way between the ends of the shell an equivalent length _L_ e is calculated in accordance with G.2.2.2.2. For a longitudinal moment separate values of _L_ e are calculated for the two resolved loads as indicated in G.2.3.4(a)(1).

### Internal Pressure

For all types of nozzle and other attachments the longitudinal and circumferential stresses in the shell due to internal pressure are calculated and added to the stresses in the shell due to the local loads. When a reinforcing pad or insert plate is specified the pressure stresses at the edge of a nozzle are calculated using the shell plus pad thickness or the insert plate thickness. Reinforcing plates used with solid attachments are not considered to carry any pressure stress. For nozzles the maximum pressure stress _f_ p in the shell is calculated in accordance with G.2.3.6.2(a) and 3.5.4. This stress includes the stress concentration effect of the nozzle opening. The membrane pressure stress _f_ pm in the shell is calculated in accordance with G.2.3.6.2(b). For nozzles, the membrane pressure stress in the shell at the attachment is not considered in Annex G. The software will check the membrane stress due to loads combined with the plain pressure stress. The resultant membrane stress intensity is then checked against 1.2 _f._ For solid attachments the pressure stresses _f_ p at the edge of the attachment are calculated in accordance with G.2.3.6.2(b). The pressure stresses in the shell at the edge of a reinforcing pad or insert plate are calculated in accordance with G.2.3.6.2(c).

### Calculation of Stresses

#### Edge Of Nozzle Or Attachment

The stresses in the shell at the edge of a nozzle or solid attachment are calculated to G.2.2 for a radial load and to G.2.3 for circumferential and longitudinal moments. For the radial load the values of the stress resultants _M_ φ / _W_ , _M_ x / _W_ , _N_ φ _t_ / _W_ and _N_ x _t_ / _W_ are evaluated from Figures G.2.2-6 to G.2.2-9. The circumferential moment is resolved into two opposed loads _W_ = 1.5 _M_ c / _C_ θ acting on rectangles of sides 2 _C_ φ x 2 _C_ x as shown in Figure G.2.3-1. The stresses are calculated as indicated on the suggested working form in Annex G. The stress resultants _M_ φ1 / _W_ , _M_ x1 / _W_ , _N_ φ1 _t_ / _W_ and _N_ x1 _t_ / _W_ are evaluated from Figures G.2.2-6 to G.2.2-9, and the stress resultants _M_ φ2 / _W_ , _M_ x2 / _W_ , _N_ φ2 _t_ / _W_ and _N_ x2 _t_ / _W_ are evaluated from Figures G.2.2-10 to G.2.2-13. The longitudinal moment is resolved into two opposed loads _W_ = 1.5 _M_ L / _C_ z acting on rectangles of sides 2 _C_ φ x 2 _C_ x as shown in Figure G.2.3-2. The stresses are calculated as indicated on the suggested working form in Annex G. The stress resultants _M_ φ1 / _W_ , _M_ x1 / _W_ , _N_ φ1 _t_ /_W_ and _N_ x1 _t_ / _W_ are evaluated from Figures G.2.2-6 to G.2.2-9 and stress resultants _M_ φ3 / _W_ , _M_ x3 / _W_ , Nφ3t / W and Nx3t / W are evaluated from Figures G.2.2-14 to G.2.2-17. Logarithmic and/or linear interpolation is used, as required, for parameters 64(_r_ /_t_ )(_C_ x / _r_ )2, 2 _C_ x / _L_ etc. If the value of these parameters exceed the chart limits, the stress resultants at the limit values are used and appropriate warning messages produced. For a circumferential moment the value of _M_ φ at the edge of a reinforcing pad is increased as recommended in G.2.7 paragraph 5. For butt welded insert nozzles or attachments with insert plates the shell thickness _t_ is taken as the corroded thickness of the insert plate. The specified thinning allowance is not applied to reinforcing pads and insert plates. Where nozzles are attached with full penetration welds the pad is assumed to be integral with the shell at the edge of the nozzle, and no proportioning of the stresses between the shell and the pad is performed. For nozzles attached with partial penetration or fillet welds, and for solid attachments, the stresses at the edge of the attachment are apportioned as recommended in G.3.1.5.2(b). **WARNING** : For solid attachments on pads, the method assumes that the pad and shell form an integral whole, such that the moments are transmitted through the pad to the shell. This is not always the case in practice - see G.3.1.5.2. Shear stresses are calculated in accordance with G.2.3.6.3.

#### Edge Of Reinforcing Pad Or Insert Plate

The stresses in the shell at the edge of a reinforcing pad or insert plate are calculated to G.2.2 for a radial load and to G.2.3 for circumferential and longitudinal moments, as for the stresses at the edge of a solid attachment. The edge of an insert plate is taken as the large end of the taper, and the shell thickness t is taken as the shell thickness less corrosion and thinning allowance.

### Stress Summation

The loaded area is divided into quadrants labelled _Q 1_, _Q 2_, _Q 3_ and _Q 4_. The summation of the stresses at the edge of the nozzle or attachment, due to the various loads and moments, is carried out at the inside and outside surface of the shell or pad in each of the four quadrants in accordance with G.2.3.6.1 - see Figure G.2.3-4 and the suggested working form in Annex G. When a pad or insert plate is fitted the summation of stresses is likewise carried out at the inside and outside surfaces of the shell at the edge of the pad or insert plate. Shear stresses are taken as positive - see G.2.3.6.1 NOTE 4. The circumferential and longitudinal stresses due to internal pressure are included in the stress summation.

### Stress Intensities

The total circumferential and longitudinal membrane stresses, _f_ φm and _f_ xm, are combined with the total shear stress τ and the membrane stress intensity _f_ m is taken as the largest absolute value of stresses _f_ 1m, _f_ 2m and _f_ 3m which are calculated in accordance with Annex B.3.1 Similarly, the total circumferential and longitudinal membrane plus bending stresses, _f_ φ and _f_ x, are combined with the total shear stress τ and the total stress intensity _f_ max is taken as the largest absolute value of stresses _f_ 1, _f_ 2 and _f_ 3 which are calculated in accordance with Annex B.3.1.

### Compressive Stress

The circumferential membrane and bending stresses due to the local loads are summed at each of the eight locations. The pressure stresses are not included in this summation. The longitudinal membrane and bending stresses due to the local loads are similarly summed. The maximum compressive stress is taken as the largest negative value of circumferential or longitudinal stress at any location where the corresponding membrane stress is compressive - see Annex A.3.3.3 and lines 30 and 32 of the suggested working form in Annex G.

### Stresses Away From The Loaded Area

It is sometimes necessary to determine stresses in the shell at a point remote from the edge of the loaded area. The program includes an option for calculating the stresses at the inside surface of the shell on the X or Y axis at a distance away from the centre of the nozzle or attachment in the longitudinal or circumferential directions respectively and exclude pressure stresses.

### Allowable Stresses

The allowable values for shear stress, membrane stress intensity and total membrane plus bending stress intensity are determined by multiplying the design strength _f_ for the appropriate material by the factors which are specified in Annex A, as detailed below. Shear stress - The allowable shear stress is 0.5 _f_ - see A.3.3.3. Membrane stress - The allowable membrane stress is 1.2 _f_ - see A.3.3.1(a). Membrane plus bending stress - For solid attachments and at the edge of reinforcing pads the allowable membrane plus bending stress is 2 _f_ - see A.3.3.1(b). At the edge of a nozzle the allowable membrane plus bending stress is 2.25 _f_ - see A.3.3.2. Compressive stress - The allowable compressive stress is 90% of the yield strength - see A.3.3.3.

### Deflection and Rotations

The deflections and rotations are evaluated in accordance with G.2.2.4 and G.2.3.5 or for hollow attachments per Enquiry Case 137, paragraph 3. The deflection _D_ z due to the radial load _W_ is calculated in accordance with G.2.2.4 using the factor d _Er_ / _W_ from Figures G.2.2-18(a), G.2.2-18(b) or G.2.2-19. The rotations due to the moments _M_ c and _M_ L are calculated in accordance with G.2.3.5 using the deflection d1 produced by the equivalent radial load _W_. For a nozzle or attachment with a reinforcing pad or insert plate, the deflections and rotations are calculated at the edge of the reinforcing pad or insert plate. For nozzles without pads the rotation due to a circumferential moment is reduced by 25% as recommended in G.2.7 paragraph 4.

### Pipe and Shell Flexibility

When considering the loadings on nozzles due to attached piping it is possible for the program to calculate a reduced radial load and reduced moments using a linear interpolation of the shell and pipe spring characteristics. To use this facility data must be entered for the free end rotations _R_ x and _R_ y and the free end deflection _D_ z. For details of this facility please refer to [Pipe and Shell Flexibility](../h9997.htm#0900). The signs of the free end deflection and rotations must be the same as those of the corresponding load and moments.

### General Limitations

Various limitations are specified in Annex G and these are checked by the program. The methods are not considered applicable if the length of the shell _L_ is less than the radius _r_ , or if the distance from the edge of the attachment to the end of the shell is less than _r_ / 2 - see G.2.2. The ratio _C_ φ /_r_ should not exceed that given in Figure G.2.2-1 depending on the value of _r_ /_t_ - see G.2.2. For values of _C_ x / _r_ greater than 0.25 the results should be used with caution - see G.2.2. For nozzles, if the distance from the edge of the nozzle to another stress concentrating feature is less than 2.5then the calculated stresses become unreliable - see NOTE in A.3.3. NOTE: This program does not repeat all the checks specified in 3.5.4. Users are assumed to have used the appropriate Nozzles Reinforcement module in conjunction with this module.

Hence the allowable membrane stress is considered to be the same as the allowable membrane plus bending stress when stresses due to internal pressure are included. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
