# ASME VIII Div.1 - Fixed Tubesheets
* * *
# Program Capabilities
The program can analyse the effects of pressure and differential thermal expansion on a fixed tubesheet exchanger, generally in accordance with ASME VIII Div.1 Section UHX or TEMA.
Tube end loads are calculated generally in accordance with ASME VIII Div.1 UW-20.4. NOTE the calculation does not take account of any radial differential thermal expansion at the tube-to-tubesheet joint.
The design of tube-to-tubesheet welds in accordance with UW-20 is not included.
The exchanger comprises a shell, optionally fitted with a shell expansion bellows, a tube bundle and two equal tubesheets. Channels are considered to be cylindrical.
The program has a Design Option to determine the minimum required thickness of the tubesheet.
Note that dimensional requirements should be manually checked for compliance with TEMA.
Note that the joint efficiency _E_ is assumed equal to 1 for shells and tubes.
Additionally the software has the capability to perform calculations to TEMA RCB-8 Flexible Shell Elements. Note that only single convolutions are taken into account.
* * *
# Operation
The program analyses the following: 
* Shell: Tensile and compressive longitudinal stresses due to pressure and differential thermal expansion. The circumferential joint efficiency _E s,w_ is assumed to be 1.0. Circumferential stress due to pressure. Note: the External Pressure module should be used for a full analysis of shells subject to external pressure.  
* Tubes: Tensile and compressive longitudinal stresses due to pressure and thermal expansion. Circumferential membrane stress due to pressure, tubes are not checked for collapse due to external pressure.  
* Tubesheet: For TEMA bending and shear stresses due to pressure and thermal expansion, additionally edge bending due to bolting, if applicable or bending stresses for ASME VIII Div.2 4.18.8.  
* Tube/Tubesheet joints: Pull out loads due to pressure and thermal expansion.
The program does not consider differential design conditions which will require agreement between the Manufacturer and the End User.
Examples of various exchanger configurations are detailed in the diagrams below - see [Channel-TS-Shell Connections](<h9989.htm#0100>).

## Design Conditions
The program can handle five design conditions simultaneously. Additional conditions can be handled by repeated use of the program. The type of condition under consideration may be specified as new or corroded, design or test:
_New:Des_  
_Cor:Des_  
_New:Tst_  
_Cor:Tst_  
The program does not consider differential design conditions which will require agreement between the Manufacturer and the End User.
## Tube End Types
See [Tube End Types](<h0198.htm#1400>)
## Metal Temperatures
See [Metal Temperatures](<h9997.htm#0800>).
## Corrosion
Corrosion allowances may be specified for both internal and external surfaces of the shell and channel, as required.
Corrosion allowances for the tubesheet may be specified for the shellside and the tubeside.
For new or as built conditions any input corrosion allowances will be ignored.
NOTE: Corrosion is not applied to tube surfaces, as these are normally considered as consumables. If corrosion is required then the corroded tube dimensions should be input.
## Joint Efficiency
For the purposes of assessing the stresses, no account is taken of joint efficiencies and _E_ is assumed to be 1.0. Any variation of _E_ should be entered by adjusting the value of allowable stress.
## Test conditions
See [Test Pressures](<h0198.htm#0200>) for the calculation of the allowable stresses and loads in the test conditions.
## Gaskets & Facings
See [Gaskets & Facings](<h0198.htm#0550>). 
## Bolting
See [Bolting](<h0198.htm#0600>) and [Bolting Data](<h9984.htm>).

## Warning and Advisory Messages
Messages printed below in _italics_ are not considered to be critical - see[Warnings Messages](<h9997.htm#0501>).
_Acceptable calculation_ | The calculations have been performed successfully.

_Bolt circle : max_ |  The bolt circle diameter is too large to comply with the recommended bolt clearances. The value displayed shows the recommended maximum.   
_Bolt circle : min_ |  The bolt circle diameter is too small to comply with the recommended bolt clearances. The value displayed shows the recommended minimum.   
Bolt stress | The bolt stress limit has been exceeded.  
_Bolt tensioning recommended_ |  The nominal bolt diameter exceeds 38 mm - see PD 5500 3.8.1.4, or the _Probable wrench load_ predicted by ASME VIII, Div.1 Nonmandatory Appendix S is less than the actual bolt load. The use of bolt tensioning or torque tightening equipment is recommended.   
_Bolt tightening controlled_ |  The bolt stress has exceeded the nominal code limit but may be acceptable for controlled bolt tightening if agreed between the designer, manufacturer and inspection authority. See also, ASME VIII, Div.1 Nonmandatory Appendix S.   
Buckling length kl  | The tube buckling stress exceeds the allowable.  
Code limitations exceeded | One or more of the limitations specified in ASME VIII Div.1 for the component have been exceeded. Use of the _Shells - Internal Pressure_ module will give detailed warning messages.  
_Contact width N\(min\)_ | The gasket width _N_ is less than the minimum recommended in Taylor Forge Modern Flange Design to avoid possible crushing during bolting-up - see [Gaskets & Facings](<h0198.htm#0550>).
