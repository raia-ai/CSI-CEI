# Tube bundle data
## Data Input
Description | Enter the tube bundle description.  
---|---  
Pitch | Select the layout or pitch type as either _Triangular_ or _Square_  
Tube end | Select the tube end type. NOTE - For PD 5500 calculations see also - [Tube End Types](<h0009.htm#0230>)  
Tested | Select _Yes_ to use values of _f_ r\(test\) from TABLE UW-20.1.NOTE this only applies to calculations performed to ASME VIII Div.1.  
Grooved | For expanded tube ends, select the number of tube hole grooves.  
Hole quantity | The number of tube holes in the tubesheet. NOTE: When drawing a tube bundle the software will not draw the actual tube layout, this drawing is only a representation of the bundle.  
Maximum quantity | The maximum number of holes that it is possible to fit in the tubesheet, calculated by the software. NB: The calculated number does not take account of any untubed lanes or baffle tie rods.  
Expanded length | For expanded tube ends, enter the length of tube expansion.  
Baffles fitted | Check this box if the tube bundle is supported by tube support or baffle plates.  
Quantity | Enter the quantity of baffle plates.  
Max span at baffles | The maximum unsupported tube length between adjacent full baffles or second segmental or doughnut baffles, calculated by the software.  
Max span at tubesheet | The maximum unsupported tube length from either tubesheet, measured to the first full baffle or second segmental or doughnut baffle, calculated by the software.  
Segmented baffles | Select _Yes_ for segmented baffles.  
Tube Material | Tube material selection from the [Material Database](<h9996.htm>).  
Total area of untubed lanes | For multi-pass exchangers the total area of untubed portions of the tubesheet. Zero for a single pass exchanger; for a 2 pass exchanger an area equal to the width of the untubed lane multiplied by the OTL - see PD 5500 Figure 3.9-2.  
## Additional Information
The location of the second tubesheet is calculated by the software, and is based on the location of the first tubesheet and the tube length input.
The tube weld throat thickness input is only relevant to EN 13445 calculations.
## Error Messages
See also [General component error messages](<h9100.htm#1000>).
Conflicting diameters | The _Tube pitch_ is less than or equal to the _Hole dia_.  
---|---  
Diameter | This could be one of the following. The _Tube OD_ is less than or equal to twice the _Tube thickness_ , the _Hole dia_ is less than or equal to the _Tube OD_.  
Maximum quantity | The _Hole quantity_ is greater than the maximum calculated by the software.  
Quantity | The _Hole quantity_ is less than the minimum of 3.
