# ASME VIII Div.1 - External Loads on Vertical Vessels
* * *
# Program Capabilities
This program calculates the static effects of external loadings on vertical vessels. The program includes the effects of the shell, heads, skirt, trays, nozzles, piping, platforms, ladders, davits and external equipment, fireproofing, insulation, entrained liquids and additional loadings specified by the user.
The following conditions may by considered:
_
Wind loading \(Erection, Operating and Test\)
Seismic loading
Accelerations
Lifting from the horizontal
_ 
Most wind and seismic Codes of Practice can be accommodated. Various EFP Sheets exist for use with the Data Sheet & Engineering Formula Processor for the interpretation of the major Codes of Practice.
The column is considered to be a free-standing cantilever and fixed at its base via anchor bolts to a concrete foundation. It may comprise multiple shell sections including cones which may be inverted.
The loadings on the column are calculated at discrete intervals determined by the overall height of the column.
Wind condition calculations cater for wind loadings on the shell, cone & skirt and additional attachments such as piping, platforms and ladders etc.
Seismic or Acceleration calculations consider elemental weight and shear calculations over the length of the column.
Stresses are calculated at the base of each shell, cone or skirt section input. The user can hence augment the number of stress calculations performed. Note that the program will automatically insert an extra stress calculation at the top of the skirt, this is to account for the strength reduction in the shirt to head weld \(assumed to be 75%\).
Stress calculations are in accordance with ASME VIII Division 1 - UG-28 and UG-23\(d\).
The natural period of vibration and the deflection are calculated for each loading case. Based on the Period of vibration and the flow regime around the top of the column \(measured by the Reynolds number\) the program will determine if wind induced vibrations are a potential problem. The user is reminded that although it is possible to model the effects of dynamic loading using this program a dynamic analysis is not being performed.
For skirts attached to a head knuckle a bending stress check is performed per EN 13445-3 Clause 16.12.3
Unless the skirt is welded to a deck anchor bolt calculations can be performed using alternative methods:
* Standard [DVHS \[21\]](<h9998.htm#0021>) method: assuming that the neutral axis for bolt tension and concrete compressive stress coincides with the vessel centre line.  
* Brownell & Young method: accounts for the relative elasticities and bonding of anchor bolt and concrete thus allowing displacement of the neutral axis - see [\[7\]](<h9998.htm#0007>).
The stress in the base plate is due to the pressure exerted by the concrete foundation, the program can account for the proximity of anchor bolt chairs.
See also [External loads.](<h9997.htm#0480>)
## Conditions
The following conditions can be evaluated, in combination if required:
### Erection
Fireproofing, liquid, trays decks and pressure are excluded. Loading is due to self-weight and wind loading. This condition generally gives the maximum stress in the anchor bolts due to wind loading.
### Operating
All design data input is considered for wind loading.
### Test
The column and attached equipment and piping are considered flooded with water. Wind loading is reduced \(as input\), the pressure is the test pressure at the top increased by the static head of water at the elevation considered. This condition corresponds to the corroded site re-test and often governs the base plate design - see [Test Pressures](<h0198.htm#0200>).
### Lifting
A non-operating condition with all loadings except fireproofing considered. The vessel is supported at two points: \(1\) an elevation specified by the user and \(2\) the base plate. The program will report the location of maximum bending stress in the uncorroded condition. Note: lifting or snatch factors are not considered.
### Seismic
An operating condition where the lateral loadings are produced by a seismic shear equal to the product of the total weight and the seismic factor. A portion of this seismic shear load may be located at the top tangent line, if required, with the remainder apportioned along the length in proportion to the elemental weight and its height - see [Basic seismic factor](<h9997.htm#0700>).
### Accelerations
An operating condition where the loadings are produced by uniform accelerations acting through the centre of gravity of each element in the lateral and/or vertical directions. Typical applications may be vessels for shipboard or off-shore operation.

# Operation
## Conventions
Elevations are specified with reference to a datum point which is generally the bottom tangent line of the vessel. Elevations may therefore be either positive or negative values, but must be an integer value of mm or inches. They may be entered in any convenient order and will be sorted into descending order by the program.
![](..\\img\\towerel.png)
The vessel is treated as a vertical cantilever. Vessels with the bottom head below the tangent line may be modelled as described below.
![](..\\img\\skirtel.png)
Vertical vessels are considered to be prevented from overturning by the use of anchor bolts and conventional anchor bolt chairs as shown in the diagram below.
![](..\\img\\lugspace.png)
**Anchor Bolt Chairs**
For accurate distribution of liquid load effects restraints are placed on vessel configurations. Any inverted cones must have a clear column of liquid above as shown in the diagram below. To ensure that the lateral effects of liquid are accurately considered \(e.g. period of vibration calculations\) the liquid is considered to act at discrete elevations along the length of the vessel.
![](..\\img\\towerliq.png)
The gravitational effects of liquid above an inverted cone are shown in the diagram below. The liquid load will be distributed as shown.
![](..\\img\\towerliq2.png)
## Corrosion
The column stiffness used in the deflection calculation and all weights are calculated in the new or as built condition. Corrosion allowance is considered to act in localised areas and affect the stress calculations only. This will generally result in analysis of the worst case conditions.
## Method
The program calculates the gross effect of external loadings.
Design conditions, wind pressure and material data can be specified as a profile of data which may vary with elevation. In the example below the column and appendages at elevations 20000mm to 15001mm will be subjected to a wind pressure of 1400 N/m2.
| Elevation | mm | 20000 | 15000 | 10000  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
| Pressure | N/m2 | 1400 | 1350 | 1250  
Material data profiles need to be specified with regard to where stress calculations will be performed, as shown in the following example.
![](..\\img\\towerthk.png)
Mohr's area moment method is employed for deflection calculations. The deflection at the top is compared against 1/200th of the height of the column.
Detailed component calculations such as formed heads and detailed analysis of cone/cylinder junctions are not considered by this module and should be handled by the relevant modules - see [Shells - Internal Pressure](<h0101.htm>) or [Shells - External Pressure](<h0102.htm>).
## Spoilers
If it is required to fit helical spoilers to prevent wind induced vibration, the wind and mass effect of these can be calculated by the inclusion of _Additional loads_ as explained below:
Elevation: _E_\(input in _mm_ or _inches_\)
Wind area: _A_
Shear: 0.0
Moment: 0.0
Weight: _W_
Moment Arm: 0.0
Where:
_E_ = 0.833 × _H_ \(in metres or feet\)
_A_ = \(1.2 - _S_\) × _D_ × _H_ / 3
_D_ = Effective diameter for wind \(in metres or feet\)
_S_ = Wind shape factor, less than unity
_H_ = Total height of the column \(in metres or feet\)
_W_ = Weight of attached spoilers
## Effective Moment Arm
The _effective_ self-weight moment arm for any attachment is dependent on its radius from the centre of the vessel, its orientation and the wind direction.
![](..\\img\\towerarm.png)
When the wind direction is at **270°** as shown above:
  * If the attachment is at **0°** or **180°** then its _effective_ moment arm is zero and the self-weight overturning moment will not affect the wind overturning moment of the vessel.
  * If the attachment is at **90°** then its _effective_ moment arm is at its most positive and the self-weight overturning moment will be added to the wind overturning moment.
  * If the attachment is at **270°** then its _effective_ moment arm is at its most negative and the self-weight overturning moment will be subtracted from the wind overturning moment.
