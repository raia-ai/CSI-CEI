# ASME VIII Div.1 - Cyclic Loading
* * *
# Program Capabilities
This program performs calculations for cycling loading generally in accordance with ASME VIII Div.2 Section 5.5, Annex 3-F & Annex 5-B using the allowable stresses for Div.1 - see [\[3\]](<h9998.htm#0003>). Reference is also made to PD 5500 Annex W.6.2.2.3 - see [\[13\]](<h9998.htm#0013>), for the calculation of the stress concentrating effects of nozzles.
The program can operate in two modes.
1\. To check the need for a fatigue analysis based on preliminary data.
2\. Perform a fatigue analysis based optionally on pressure, stress or loading data.
* * *
# Operation
The data input represents the peak and trough values of a particular pressure, load or stress cycle as shown in the diagram below:
