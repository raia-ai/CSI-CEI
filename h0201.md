# EN 13445 - Shells - Internal Pressure
# Cylindrical or Conical Shells & Heads
* * *
# Program Capabilities
This program performs the calculations for cylindrical and conical shells and formed heads subject to internal pressure in accordance with EN 13445 Clause 7.
Standard test pressures are calculated in accordance with EN 13445-5 Clause 10.2.3.3.
The program also calculates the internal volume and empty weight of the shell, cone or head. The weight and volume for a dished head includes the straight flange \(cylindrical portion\) of the head.

# Operation
## Cylindrical Shells
The required thickness _e_ is calculated in accordance with Clause 7.4.2.
## Conical Shells
For conical shells, with or without knuckles, the required thickness of the cone is calculated in accordance with Clause 7.6. 
Below is an example of data input for cone locations, one with stiffeners at either end and one without - see also [Conical Shells](<h9987.htm>).

## Ellipsoidal Heads
The required thickness _e_ is calculated in accordance with Clause 7.5.4.
In accordance with the requirements of Clause 7.5.3.4 the required thickness of the cylindrical or straight flange portion of the head is calculated using Clause 7.4.2. The required thickness _e_ in the output is the larger of the required thicknesses of the head and the straight flange.
The limitations on head proportions and thickness in Clause 7.5.3.1 are also checked.
## Hemispherical Heads
The required thickness _e_ is calculated in accordance with Clause 7.4.3.
## Torispherical Heads
The required thickness _e_ is calculated in accordance with Clause 7.5.3. The internal head height _h i_ is calculated using a formula matching that given in the definition of _h i_ in Clause 7.5.3.2 using internal spherical and knuckle radii _R_ and _r_.
In accordance with the requirements of Clause 7.5.3.4 the required thickness of the cylindrical or straight flange portion of the head is calculated using Clause 7.4.2. The required thickness _e_ in the output is the larger of the required thicknesses of the head and the straight flange.
The limitations on head proportions and thickness in Clause 7.5.3.1 are also checked.
## Test Conditions
The program calculates the standard shop \(uncorroded\) test pressures _p_ t in accordance with EN 13445-5 Clause 10.2.3.3, for the location under consideration. The thickness _e min_ used is the new thickness. The pressure _p_ includes any liquid static head specified at that location.
Because the actual test pressures to be applied may be controlled by another section of the vessel the program includes a facility to check the actual shop hydrostatic test condition by entering the appropriate test pressures under Shop test pressure - see [Test Pressures](<h0298.htm#0300>).
The specified test pressures are checked against the standard shop test pressures calculated by the program. If the specified shop test pressure is less than or equal to 1.08 times the corresponding standard test pressure then no check is required and a warning message will be produced.
For ellipsoidal or torispherical heads, the program calculates the maximum allowable working pressure for the head as the lowest value of the allowable working pressures for the knuckle, crown and straight flange portions of the head, using the design strength at room temperature.
