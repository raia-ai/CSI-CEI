# Design condition data
Description | Enter the condition description.  
---|---  
Pressure input | Select _Design pressure_ or _Pressure + static head_ , See [Internal Pressure](<h9997.htm#0300>).  
Design | Select the type of condition under consideration: design or test, as built or corroded.  
Shop test pressure | The pressure to be used for testing the vessel in the new and uncorroded condition.  
Site test pressure | The pressure to be used for testing the vessel in the corroded condition after it has been in service.  
Tubesheet | Tubesheet design temperature.  
Special equipment | Select _Yes_ to permit the input of pressure/temperature data acting on the external surface of the vessel. The default external pressures are zero and the default external temperature is room temperature.  
External pressure | The external pressure acting on the entire vessel for subsea equipment or equipment contained within another pressure vessel. For normal equipment this value would be zero.  
External vacuum | The external vacuum acting on the entire vessel for extraterrestrial equipment or equipment contained within another pressure vessel. For normal equipment this value would be zero.  
External temperature | The external temperature acting on the entire vessel for extraterrestrial, subsea equipment or equipment contained within another pressure vessel. For normal equipment this value would be the ambient temperature.  
### Space data
This data is specific to the selected _Internal Space_.
Internal Space | Select the _Internal Space_ to which the following design data is to be applied.  
---|---  
Design temp | The design temperature.  
Max pressure | The maximum internal pressure acting within this _Internal Space_ , including the effects of liquid static head and/or pressure drops as applicable. Used with an external space as the basis for the _Design pressure_.  
Max vacuum | The maximum vacuum pressure within this _Internal Space_. Used with an external space as the basis for the _External design pressure_.  
Corrosion: int | Internal corrosion allowance to be deducted from the as built thickness.  
Corrosion: ext | External corrosion allowance to be deducted from the as built thickness.  
Liquid SG | The specific gravity of the space contents. The specific gravity of water is 1.0.  
Liquid height | For _Pressure + static head_ option the height of liquid to be used for calculating the static head.  
Liquid level | Height of liquid in the vessel, measured from the bottom inside surface in the uncorroded condition. This is used for calculating the weight of the liquid contents.  
Operating pres. | Operating internal pressure acting within this _Internal Space_ , including the effects of liquid static head and/or pressure drops as applicable.  
Operating vac. | Operating vacuum acting within this _Internal Space_.  
### Shellside data
This data is specific to this design condition.
Corrosion: SS | Shellside corrosion allowance to be deducted from the as built tubesheet thickness.  
---|---  
Shop test pressure | The pressure to be used for testing the vessel in the new and uncorroded condition.  
Site test pressure | The pressure to be used for testing the vessel in the corroded condition after it has been in service.  
Coeff h | Shellside heat transfer coefficient.  
Metal temp | The mean metal temperature of the shell material.  
### Tubeside data
This data is specific to this design condition.
Corrosion: TS | Tubeside corrosion allowance to be deducted from the as built tubesheet thickness.  
---|---  
Shop test pressure | The pressure to be used for testing the vessel in the new and uncorroded condition.  
Site test pressure | The pressure to be used for testing the vessel in the corroded condition after it has been in service.  
Coeff h | Tubeside heat transfer coefficient.  
Metal temp | The mean metal temperature of the tube material.  
## Additional Information
Metal temps known | Select _Yes_ if the actual Shell and Tube metal temperatures are known and will be used as the basis of calculation - see [Metal Temperatures](<h9997.htm#0800>).  
---|---  
If _Metal temps known_ is set to _No_ then a diagram will be displayed representing the Inlet and Outlet fluid temperatures in the Shellside and Tubeside.
A diagram will be displayed representing the Metal temperatures at the tubesheet rim, of the Shell, Channel and Tubesheet.
