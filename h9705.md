# Worked Example
## Centre of Gravity
This is a simple but useful program which calculates the location of the Centre of Gravity of an item given a variable number of components of a certain weight and relative location.
First of all, however, it is necessary to create an Input File by the use of the [Linker](<h9704.htm>) option. Name this input file **C of G calc**.
To examine this example, select the [Read Input](<h9801.htm#0100>) option from the File menu and Read the Input File **C of G calc**.
The sheet will now be displayed on the screen. Try changing the numbers in the columns headed **Weight \(kg\)** ,**Vertical** ,**North** and**East** , and press the ![](..\\img\\calc.png) button. A pop-up window will now be displayed showing the calculation progress, this will display the following:
_Computing Page 1_
followed by any messages from the equation file.
When the calculation has been performed the Calculation Status window will be displayed with the message _Calculation_ _Complete_. Also note that two additional buttons have become live ![](..\\img\\fileout.png) [Save Output](<h9801.htm#0300>) and ![](..\\img\\fileprnt.png) [Quick Print](<h9801.htm#0400>).
This Data Sheet has been set up to permit the use of variable length tables. To see this in operation, move the cursor onto the table line to be copied, using the \[**Tab**\] key or the mouse, then press the ![](..\\img\\plus1.png) button. This will result in a copy of that line being made directly below it, thus increasing the length of the table. Now change the input data on the additional line to create a new component with different weights and locations.
Having done this, recalculate the sheet. Observe the changed results. To delete lines from the table, move the cursor to the line to be erased, then press the ![](..\\img\\minus1.png) button. All lines apart from the first line can be deleted in this way. There must be at least one line per table.
## Data Sheet Creation
This section takes the user through the various stages of creating the above example.
### Screen File
The first step is to create the screen file, follow the procedures described in [Screen Files](<h9703.htm#0200>).
The diagram below shows the screen layout of the example to be created.
![](..\\img\\efpex1.png)
The cursor will be blinking at the top left-hand corner of the screen. Where possible leaving the input and output fields to be created last, the screen layout as depicted above is now created as follows:
Lines 1-5 | Follow the procedures described in [Screen Files](<h9703.htm#0200>) for positioning the text on the screen.  
---|---  
Line 6 | This line is the table line and its five input fields are created as follows:  
| Position the cursor in column 1, then press the spacebar 76 times to fill the line with spaces.  
| Position the cursor back in column 1, holding down the left mouse button drag the cursor to column 11. Then right click on the highlighted spaces and select **Alpha Field** from the pop-up menu. 11 \(Pink\) \# symbols will be displayed in the field created.  
| Position the cursor in column 19, holding down the left mouse button drag the cursor to column 28. Then right click on the highlighted spaces and select **Input Field** from the pop-up menu. This will result in 9 \(Red\) \# symbols will be displayed in the field created.  
| Position the cursor in column 36, holding down the left mouse button drag the cursor to column 45. Then right click on the highlighted spaces and select **Input Field** from the pop-up menu. This will result in 9 \(Red\) \# symbols will be displayed in the field created.  
| Position the cursor in column 52, holding down the left mouse button drag the cursor to column 61. Then right click on the highlighted spaces and select **Input Field** from the pop-up menu. This will result in 9 \(Red\) \# symbols will be displayed in the field created.  
| Position the cursor in column 68, holding down the left mouse button drag the cursor to column 77. Then right click on the highlighted spaces and select **Input Field** from the pop-up menu. This will result in 9 \(Red\) \# symbols will be displayed in the field created.  
| To change the line attribute to a table, highlight any part of the line then right click and select **Enable Table Line** from the pop-up menu. The whole line will be underlined.  
Line 7 | Using the dash/minus \(-\) symbol, draw the underline for summing the weight column.  
Line 8 | Position the text**Total Weight** and then move the cursor to column 19, holding down the left mouse button drag the cursor to column 28. Then right click on the highlighted spaces and select **Output Field** from the pop-up menu. 9 \(Blue\) \# symbols will be displayed in the field created.  
Line 9 | This line, for purposes of clarity, is to remain blank.  
Line 10 | Position the text **Centre of Gravity : Vertical from Base** and then move the cursor to column 68, holding down the left mouse button drag the cursor to column 77. Then right click on the highlighted spaces and select **Output Field** from the pop-up menu. 9 \(Blue\) \# symbols will be displayed in the field created.  
Line 11 | Position the text : **North** and then move the cursor to column 68, holding down the left mouse button drag the cursor to column 77. Then right click on the highlighted spaces and select **Output Field** from the pop-up menu. 9 \(Blue\) \# symbols will be displayed in the field created.  
Line 12 | Position the text : **East** and then move the cursor to column 68, holding down the left mouse button drag the cursor to column 28. Then right click on the highlighted spaces and select **Output Field** from the pop-up menu. 9 \(Blue\) \# symbols will be displayed in the field created.  
Press ![](..\\img\\filesave.png) to save the screen file.
### Equation File
The next step is to create the equation file. Follow the procedures described in [Equation Files](<h9703.htm#0500>) for positioning the text on the screen to do this.
![](..\\img\\efpex2.png)
The cursor will be blinking at the top left-hand corner of the screen. The equations should be entered as illustrated above, being careful to ensure the correct matching of parentheses.
The **semi-colon** indicates that anything following on the same line is a comments to aid readability and is ignored when the equations are processed. The comments in this equation file and in the other tutorial examples, explain the action performed by each equation.
### Linking Files
This has to be done to produce an Input File, containing the appropriate information from Screen, Equation and Function files. To do this refer to [EFP Linker](<h9704.htm>).
From the EFP Tools menu select _Linker_. From the subsequent screen select the Screen file with the name _Centre of Gravity_ from the Screen Files list box by double-clicking on it. Similarly select the Equation file with the name _Centre of Gravity_ from the list Equation Files list box. From the Function Files list box select <None>, since the Centre of Gravity program has no Function file associated with it. These selections will be displayed in the appropriate columns of the Link List list box.
Press the OK button, and then select the destination _Project_ and _Item_ for the link file. Enter the required description as **C of G calc** and press the OK button to save the file.
