# PD 5500 - Bolted Flanged Connections
* * *
# Program Capabilities
This program performs the calculations for circular bolted flanges subject to internal or external pressure, in accordance with PD 5500 Section 3.8 or EN 1591. Flanges may be narrow-faced or full-faced. For narrow-faced flanges the gasket contact face must be entirely within the circle enclosed by the bolts, except for reverse flanges where the gasket may alternatively be entirely outside the bolt circle.
Flanges may be with or without hubs, and may be butt welded, fillet welded or lap jointed. Fillet welded flanges without hubs may be designed by either the integral or the loose method. Fillet weld sizes are checked to Annex E Figure E.31 or E.33. Although 3.8.3.1 allows butt welded flanges to be designed by either the integral or the loose method, the program only uses the integral method for these flanges.
In addition to pressure loading the program can also take account of the effects of an applied axial force and a bending moment if required.
Bolting data for standard metric and inch series bolts is provided by the program. Physical clearances of the edge and hub are checked. Applied bolt loads for the gasket seating and operating conditions may be specified if required.
The requirements of TEMA Section 5 RCB-11.7 [\[26\]](<h9998.htm#0026>) for [Gaskets with Pass partition ribs](<h9985.htm#1000>) can be considered, if required.
In addition to checking the design of a flange with specified dimensions, the program also has the facility to optimise any of the following: the bolting, the gasket location, the hub length, the hub large end diameter and the flange thickness.
When the calculations have been performed the flange may be drawn on the screen to facilitate the checking of clearances and proportions. The program also calculates the approximate weight of the flange.
All thicknesses are entered in the new or as built condition. Both internal and external corrosion allowances may be specified as required - see Corrosion.
The shell to which the flange is fitted may be specified by either inside or outside diameter. A thinning allowance may be specified either as a percentage of the new thickness or as an absolute value in mm or inches. The thinning allowance is always applied to the inside surface.

# Operation using the Standard \(Taylor Forge\) method
## Flange Types
There are two basic flange types covered by the program as shown in [Flange to Shell Connections](<h9992.htm>):
Normal flanges where the bolt circle diameter is outside the shell - see Suggested working forms \(1\) to \(8\) and \(13\).
Reverse flanges where the bolt circle diameter is inside the shell - see Suggested working forms \(9\) to \(12\) and \(15\). NOTE: For narrow-faced reverse flanges the program permits the bolts to be located either inside or outside the gasket.
Flanges may be specified with or without a hub at the back of the flange, except for reverse fillet welded types which must be without a hub.
## Gaskets & Facings
See [Gaskets & Facings](<h0098.htm#0700>).
## Bolting
See [Bolting](<h0098.htm#0500>) and [Bolting Data](<h9984.htm>).
## Corrosion
The corrosion allowances are applied to the internal and external surfaces of the flange and the shell as shown in [Flange to Shell Connections](<h9992.htm>).
## Applied Force and Bending Moment
In addition to pressure loading the program can also take account of the effects of an axial force and a bending moment acting in a plane through the axis of the shell or nozzle to which the flange is attached. The method employed is superior to that suggested in Enquiry Case 5500/123. Typically these loadings may be due to wind and dead weight loadings on vessels or piping loads on nozzles. The axial force may be specified as positive or negative; a positive force being tensile. The bending moment is converted into an equivalent axial force _H_ Dm:
![](..\\img\\q0026.png)
Where _D_ m is the shell mean diameter.
## Calculations
Calculations are in accordance with PD 5500 Section 3.8.
### Integral And Loose Design Methods
Integral Method - For this method the flange and shell \(or nozzle neck\) are considered to be the equivalent of an integral structure and account is taken of the support from the shell. Stresses are calculated in the flange and in the hub or the shell, depending on the type of flange. For fillet welded flanges the shell and the fillet weld at the back of the flange are considered to act as a hub.
Loose Method - For this method the flange is assumed to get no support in bending from the shell and hence imposes no bending stresses in the shell. Except for lap joint flanges, various limitations on the application of the loose method are specified in 3.8.3.1\(b\). These are checked by the program.
NOTE: Fillet welded flanges with hubs \(slip-on hubbed type\) and lap joint backing flanges with hubs are designed by the loose method, but additional calculations are performed for the stress in the hub.
![](..\\img\\integvloose.png)
### Bolt Loads
Bolt loads _W_ m1 and _W_ m2 are calculated for the operating and bolting-up conditions respectively, in accordance with 3.8.3.2 for narrow-faced flanges, or 3.8.4.2 for full-faced flanges, or 3.8.7.3 for reverse full-faced flanges.
NOTE: For lap joint flanges the bolt loads are calculated using the dimensions and facing details for the lap.
The operating bolt load _W_ m1 is modified to include the effects of the applied axial force _H_ Df and the equivalent force _H_ Dm due to the applied moment. The maximum tensile force is used for evaluating _W_ m1.
The applied bolt loads for the operating and bolting-up conditions, when specified by the user, are checked against the calculated loads and the higher values are used to evaluate the required bolt cross-section areas _A_ m1 and _A_ m2 \- see 3.8.3.2. The total required bolt cross-section area _A_ m is taken as the greater of _A_ m1 and _A_ m2, and is checked against the actual cross-section area of the bolts _A_ b.
For narrow-faced flanges the flange design bolt load W is calculated as 1/2\(_A_ m \+ _A_ b\)Sa \- see 3.8.2 definition of _W_. If it is necessary for the flange to be suitable to withstand the full available bolt load _A_ b _S_ a then the user should enter a value equal to _A_ b _S_ a in the input as Applied load: bolting-up.
### Flange Moments
Moments are calculated for the operating and bolting-up conditions generally in accordance with 3.8.3.3, 3.8.3.5, 3.8.3.6, 3.8.4.3, 3.8.6 or 3.8.7.3 as appropriate. For lap joint flanges separate moment calculations are performed for the lap and the loose backing flange - see 3.8.3.6.
SIGN CONVENTION: The sign convention used in the program is as follows: 
  * Positive loads are those which produce tension in the bolts.  
  * Moment arms are positive measured from the bolt circle diameter inwards towards the centre-line of the shell.
NOTE: For reverse full-faced flanges there are two alternative methods given in PD 5500. The program performs the calculations in accordance with 3.8.7.3 and Suggested working form \(15\).
The hydrostatic end force _H_ D is modified to include the effects of the applied axial force _H_ Df and the equivalent force _H_ Dm due to the applied moment. The gasket load _H_ G is modified to take account of any applied bolt load in the operating condition.
Moments are calculated about the bolt circle diameter _C_ to 3.8.3.3, 3.8.4.3, 3.8.6 or 3.8.7.3 for the maximum tensile load \(as for a flange subject to internal pressure\), taking the positive value of _H_ Dm. Moments are also calculated about the gasket diameter _G_ to 3.8.3.5 for the maximum compressive load, taking the negative value of _H_ Dm. The operating moment is the larger of the moments from the two cases.
For calculating the moments in a lap the diameter _C_ is taken as the mean diameter _G_ 1 of the contact face between the lap and the loose backing flange.
NOTE: For the compressive load case, if the moment arms \(_h_ D \- _h_ G\) and \(_h_ T \- _h_ G\) are of opposite sign, the moment is taken as the larger of _H_ D\(_h_ D \- _h_ G\) or _H_ T\(_h_ T \- _h_ G\).
### Flange Factors
The flange factors _T_ , _U_ , _Y_ and _Z_ are evaluated using the equations given on Figure 3.8-5. The integral flange factors _F_ and _V_ , the loose hub factors _F_ L and _V_ L, and the hub stress correction factor _f_ are evaluated using the equations given in ASME VIII Div.1, TABLE 2-7.1. See also Figures 3.8.6 to 3.8.10.
NOTE: For large values of _h_ / _h_ 0 and _g_ 1 / _g_ 0 outside the range of Figures 3.8-6 to 3.8-10 the equations become discontinuous, and unreliable values of the various factors may be evaluated. A warning message _Ratio g 1/go_ will be given if this occurs.
## Flange Stresses
### Integral Method
For narrow-faced flanges designed using the integral method the longitudinal hub stress _S_ H, radial flange stress _S_ R and tangential flange stress _S_ T are calculated for the operating and bolting-up conditions in accordance with 3.8.3.4.1\(a\). The average stress is calculated as the greater of 1/2 \(_S_ H \+ _S_ R\) or 1/2 \(_S_ H \+ _S_ T\).
### Loose Flanges with a Hub
For lap joint backing flanges with a hub or narrow-faced fillet welded flanges with a hub the stresses are calculated to 3.8.3.4.1\(a\), as for the integral method.
### Loose Method
For narrow-faced flanges without a hub designed using the loose method the tangential flange stress _S_ T is calculated for the operating and bolting-up conditions in accordance with 3.8.3.4.1\(b\). The longitudinal hub stress _S_ H and radial flange stress _S_ R are taken as zero.
### Full-faced Flanges
For full-faced flanges the required flange thickness _t_ is calculated in accordance with 3.8.4.3. The required thickness to satisfy the bolt spacing criterion is also calculated.
### Lap Joints
For lap joint flanges the stresses are calculated for both the loose backing flange and the lap, as required by 3.8.3.6, using the appropriate method as indicated above. In addition the bearing stress at the contact face between the flange and the lap is also calculated for the operating and bolting-up conditions.
NOTE: If the facing on the lap is specified as full-faced but the gasket width does not straddle the mean diameter of the contact face between the lap and the loose backing flange, a fatal warning message will be produced.
### Reverse Flanges
For reverse narrow-faced flanges the longitudinal hub stress _S_ H, radial flange stress _S_ R and tangential flange stress _S_ T are calculated for the operating and bolting-up conditions in accordance with 3.8.3.4.1\(a\).
For reverse full-faced flanges the required flange thickness _t_ is calculated in accordance with 3.8.4.3. The required thickness to satisfy the bolt spacing criterion is also calculated.
## Allowable Flange Design Stresses
For the operating and bolting-up conditions the allowable flange design stresses are determined in accordance with 3.8.3.4.2, and are based on the specified design strengths at the design temperature and at atmospheric temperature respectively.
For butt welded flanges with a hub the allowable longitudinal hub stress is the smaller of 1.5 _S_ HO or 1.5 _S_ FO for the operating condition, and the smaller of 1.5 _S_ HA or 1.5 _S_ FA for the bolting-up condition. _S_ FO and _S_ FA are the design strengths for the flange material at the design and room temperatures respectively. _S_ HO and _S_ HA are the design strengths for the shell material, except for butt welded or fillet welded flanges with a hub when _S_ HO and _S_ HA are the design strengths for the flange material.
The allowable radial, tangential and average flange stresses are equal to _S_ FO in the operating condition and _S_ FA in the bolting-up condition.
The allowable bearing stresses in the flange are 1.5 _S_ FO and 1.5 _S_ FA in the operating and bolting-up conditions respectively. The allowable bearing stresses in the lap are 1.5 times the design strengths for the shell material at the design and room temperatures.
## Design Optimisation
In addition to checking a flange with specified dimensions, the program also has the facility to optimise certain parameters - see [Design optimisation](<h9997.htm#0390>).
## Flange Pairs
For the design of pairs of flanges it is sometimes necessary to perform the calculations separately for each flange. This situation occurs with the flanges used either side of a heat exchanger tubesheet, where the design conditions and/or gaskets are not the same; and with flanges having different inside diameters, such as those used to connect the shell cover to the shell on a floating head exchanger.
The program incorporates the following features to enable these calculations to be performed correctly:
Dependent on the [Bolt tightening method](<h9997.htm#0400>) selected, pre determined bolt loads can be applied.
If the design bolt load is determined from a mating flange, these bolt loads can used - see [Loads across Tubesheets](<h9997.htm#0410>)
See also 3.8.3.3; for full faced gasketed flanges the additional bolt load is balanced by the gasket and flange balancing reaction force _H r_.
The mating flange inside diameter is specified by the user so that the gasket seating width is correctly calculated for flanges with different diameters.
## Weld Sizes and Weld Strengths
For fillet welded flanges the weld sizes are checked to Annex E, as follows:
_Fillet welded: Stepped_ \- checked to Figure E.36. NOTE: The recess depth is not checked.
_Fillet welded: Smooth_ \- checked to Figure E.34. NOTE: the weld at the flange face is not checked.
For fillet welded flanges the shear on the flange to shell welds is calculated for the operating and bolting-up conditions and the shear in the weld leg is checked using the lower of the shell or flange allowable stresses multiplied by 0.5 - see A.3.3.3. For a _Fillet welded: Smooth_ the load is considered to be carried by the outer fillet weld only.
The lap to shell weld \(if any\) is not specified and so is not checked by the program.
## Rigidity Index
PD 5500 does not include checks on flange deflection or rotation, however the program will calculate the rigidity index _J_ in accordance with ASME VIII Div.1 Appendix 2-14. No output is produced for this calculation but a warning will be given if the calculated rigidity index _J_ is greater than 1.0. For lap jointed flanges the rigidity check is performed for the main flange only.
## Load cases
For PD 5500 section 3.8 two load cases are considered:
1 | Bolting up condition.  
---|---  
2 | Operating condition.

![](..\\img\\q0032.png)
![](..\\img\\q0033.png)
## Flange parameters
The effective dimensions of the flange are calculated in accordance with Section 6.1.
Flexibility flange parameters are calculated in accordance with Section 6.2.4.
**NOTE:** _c_ 1 is assumed to be zero for the EN 1591 method.
**NOTE:** Reverse flanges are not currently included in the EN 1591 method.
## Bolt parameters
Bolt parameters are calculated in accordance with Section 6.3.
## Gasket parameters
Gasket theoretical and effective dimensions are calculated in accordance with Sections 6.4.2 and 6.4.3 respectively. The flexibility of the gasket is calculated in accordance with Section 6.4.4. The software does not take into account plastic deformation of the gasket.
**NOTE:** The Alternative Method cover narrow face joints only.
## Internal forces
Internal forces in the joint are calculated in accordance with Section 7 for both applied loads and additional external loads.
The compliance of the joint and the minimum forces necessary for the gasket are calculated in accordance with Section 7.3 and 7.4 respectively.
The internal forces in the assembly condition are calculated in accordance with Section 7.5 and the bolt-load scatter at assembly is calculated in accordance with Section 7.5.2.
The internal forces in the subsequent conditions are calculated in accordance with Section 7.6.
## Load ratios
The following load ratios and their respective allowables are calculated:
_Component_ | _Ratio_ | _EN 1591-1 Section_  
---|---|---  
Bolts | _Φ_ B | 6.2  
Gasket | _Φ_ G | 6.3  
Integral flange & collar | _Φ_ F | 6.4  
Loose flange | _Φ_ L | 6.6  
## Flange Pairs
The EN 1591 method is based on flange pairs. Currently the program assumes the flange pair to consist of two identical flanges.
Dependent on the [Bolt tightening method](<h9997.htm#0400>) selected, pre determined bolt loads can be applied.
## Load cases
For EN 1591 four load cases are considered:
1 | Assembly condition.  
---|---  
2 | Operating condition with the applied bending moment _M_ A positive  
3 | Operating condition with the applied bending moment _M_ A negative.  
4 | Periodic test condition with the applied bending moment _M_ A positive

# System Messages
## Warning and Advisory Messages
Messages printed below in _italics_ are not considered to be critical - see [Warnings Messages](<h9997.htm#0501>).
_Acceptable calculation_ | The calculations have been performed successfully and the calculated stresses are less than the corresponding allowable stresses.  
---|---  
_Alternate load case may govern_ | The force due to the applied load on the shell opposes the hydrostatic end force _H_ D. A zero pressure condition may control the design.  
_Bolt circle : max_ |  The bolt circle diameter is too large to comply with the recommended bolt clearances. The value displayed shows the recommended maximum. For Reverse flanges the gasket is assumed to be inside the bolting.   
_Bolt circle : min_ |  The bolt circle diameter is too small to comply with the recommended bolt clearances. The value displayed shows the recommended minimum. For Reverse flanges the gasket is assumed to be inside the bolting.   
Bolt stress | The bolt stress limit has been exceeded.  
_Bolt tensioning recommended_ |  The nominal bolt diameter exceeds 38 mm - see 3.8.1.4, or the _Probable wrench load_ predicted by ASME VIII, Div.1 Nonmandatory Appendix S is less than the actual bolt load. The use of bolt tensioning or torque tightening equipment is recommended.  
_Bolt tightening controlled_ |  The bolt stress has exceeded the nominal code limit but may be acceptable for controlled bolt tightening if agreed between the designer, manufacturer and inspection authority. See also, ASME VIII, Div.1 Nonmandatory Appendix S.
