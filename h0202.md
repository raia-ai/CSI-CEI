# EN 13445 - Shells - External Pressure
# Cylindrical or Conical Shells & Heads
* * *
# Program Capabilities
This program performs the calculations for cylindrical and conical shells and formed heads subject to external pressure in accordance with EN 13445 Clause 8.
If the external design pressure exceeds the internal design pressure for the shell, head or cone then the user is advised to check the thickness using the _Shells - Internal Pressure_ module, with the design pressure set equal to the required external design pressure.
The calculations assume that the out of roundness of the shell or head complies with the requirements of Clause 8.5.1. If the out of roundness of a cylindrical shell exceeds the permitted tolerance then the allowable external pressure may be estimated by the procedure given in EN 13445-3 Annex F. An EFP sheet is available for performing this additional calculation.

# Operation
## Cylindrical Shells
For cylindrical shells with or without stiffening rings the program calculates the maximum allowable external working pressure _p_ in accordance with the requirements of Clause 8.5.2.2 for the effective shell length.
For unstiffened shells the effective shell length between End location 1 and End location 2 should be as shown in Clause 8.5.2.
NOTE 1: When the cylindrical shell is attached to a formed head, a length equal to 40% of the inside head height, measured from the tangent line, must be included in the effective length at that end.
NOTE 2: When the cylindrical shell is attached to a cone with a half apex angle less than 30° the effective length must include the axial length of the cone - see Cone to Cylinder Intersections.
If the unstiffened shell thickness is not suitable for the required external pressure it may be necessary to provide one or more stiffening rings. The calculations for the stiffening rings are performed in accordance with Clause 8.5.3 for _Light Stiffeners_. The proportions of the stiffening rings are checked.
Stiffening rings may be either internal or external, and most stiffener types which consist of a combination of rectangular sections may be defined.
Stiffener positions are specified in terms of a Subject stiffener location \(the one to be analysed\) and the adjacent stiffeners on either side \(Stiffener or end location 1 and Stiffener or end location 2\) which, if not applicable in a particular case, can be located at the ends of the shell. The Diagram below shows a typical example of a shell provided with two stiffening rings of identical section but unequally spaced along the shell.
![](..\\img\\stifloc1.png)
Assuming the 'datum' location is at 0, the following data would be entered:
| End location 1 | mm | -250.0 |   
---|---|---|---|---  
| Stiffener or end locn 1 | mm | -250.0 |   
| Subject stiffener locn  | mm | 2500.0 |   
| Stiffener or end locn 2 | mm | 4600.0 |   
| End location 2 | mm | 6350.0 |   
The datum point need not necessarily be positioned at the tan-line. On a vertical vessel, for example, the datum point could be at the underside of the base plate.
Only one stiffener may be checked in a single run of the program. If all the stiffeners on the shell are identical, the data should be entered for the section of shell with the longest effective length. If the stiffeners are not identical it will be necessary to perform separate calculations for each stiffener size or location.
The maximum allowable external working pressure is calculated for the longer of the shell sections either side of the subject stiffener \(in the example above a shell length _L_ of 2750 mm would be calculated by the program\).
## Conical Shells
Conical shells with or without knuckles at the large and small ends may be specified. If the knuckle radius is zero then the program assumes that no knuckle is present. If a knuckle radius is specified the program will perform the calculations for the conical section, excluding the knuckle. The program does not cater for cones with a half apex angle exceeding 75°- see Clause 8.6.1.
The program calculates the maximum allowable external working pressure p in accordance with the requirements of Clause 8.6 for the effective length specified. For unstiffened cones the axial length _L_ is as shown in Figure 8.6-2.
NOTE: If the cone is attached to a cylindrical shell at the large end, the cone may only be analysed separately if the cone to cylinder junction is considered to act as a plane of substantial support - see Cone to Cylinder Intersections. If the cone to cylinder junction is not considered to act as plane of substantial support the length of the cone should be included with the adjacent cylindrical shell - see Figure 8.5-2.
If the unstiffened cone thickness is not suitable for the required external pressure it may be necessary to provide one or more stiffening rings. The calculations for the stiffeners are performed in accordance with Clause 8.6.4 for _Light Stiffeners_.
Stiffening rings may be either internal or external, and most stiffener types which consist of a combination of rectangular sections may be defined.
See also [Conical Shells](<h9987.htm>)
Only one stiffener may be checked in a single run of the program. If more than one stiffener is required on the cone it will be necessary to perform separate calculations for each stiffener.
The maximum allowable external working pressure is calculated for both the small end \(Stiffener or end location 2 to Subject stiffener location\) and for the large end \(Subject stiffener location to Stiffener or end location 1\).
NOTE: The _Shells - Internal Pressure_ module should be run in order to check the geometrical limitations.
## Cone to Cylinder Intersections
The cone to cylinder intersection at the large end of a cone may be considered as a plane of substantial support provided that the requirements of Clause 8.6.5 are met. If these requirements are not met then the effective length _L_ of the cylindrical shell should include the axial length of the attached cone.
For the cone to cylinder intersection at the end of a cone additional thickening or local stiffening may be necessary, this calculation is beyond the scope of this module - see Clause 8.6.5.1&2.
## Ellipsoidal Heads
The maximum allowable external working pressure _p_ is calculated in accordance with Clause 8.8.3.
## Hemispherical Heads
The maximum allowable external working pressure is calculated in accordance with Clause 8.8.1.
## Torispherical Heads
The maximum allowable external working pressure _p_ is calculated in accordance with Clause 8.8.2.
## Specification and Attachment of Stiffening Rings
A variety of typical stiffening rings may be specified - see [Specification of Stiffening Rings](<h9990.htm>). Stiffeners may be attached to the shell by a continuous full penetration weld, or by continuous or intermittent fillet welds on both sides. If the stiffener includes a lower flange then a fillet weld must be specified. Weld sizes are not checked by the program.

# System Messages
## Warning and Advisory Messages
Messages printed below in _italics_ are not considered to be critical - see [Warnings Messages](<h9997.htm#0501>).
_Acceptable calculation_ | The calculations have been performed successfully and the shell, cone or head thickness is sufficient for the specified design external pressure. The stiffener size, when specified, is sufficient.  
---|---  
Additional loads | Additional loads have been input but are not catered for in this module.  
Code limitations exceeded | One or more of the limitations specified in EN 13445 for the component have been exceeded. Use of the _Shells - Internal Pressure_ module will give detailed warning messages.  
EN 13445-5 Table 6.6.1-1 | One or more of the parameters in the table _Testing groups for steel pressure vessels_ is outside the limits.  
Insufficient thk | The shell, cone or head is too thin for equivalent internal pressure.  
_Length Le_ | The length _Le_ has exceeded half the bay length._Le_ is taken as half the bay length  
_Low temperature_ | Further analysis per EN 13445-2 Annex B may be required - see [Limitations](<h9996.htm#0700>).  
Pressure Pg | The limit in the equation \(8.5.3-31\) has been exceeded.  
_Ratio e/R_ | The value of e/R is outside the limits in Clause 8.5.3.6.3. When e/R is less than 12×10-7 _Le_ is assumed to be zero.  
Sigma.i | The stiffener stress si is insufficient.  
Sigma.s | The stiffener stress ss limit has been exceeded - see Clause 8.5.3.6.4.  
Stiffener proportions | The proportions of stiffeners are outside the limits in Table 8.5-4 or 8.5-5 - see Clause 8.5.3.8.  
_Table values out of range_ | The limits of Table 8.5-4 or 8.5-5 have been exceeded.  
Thick shell theory reqd | Thin shell theory rules are not necessarily applicable - see [Shells & Heads](<h0298.htm#0100>).  
Unsuitable for external pressure | The calculated allowable external pressure for the shell, cone or head is less than the specified design external pressure.  
## Fatal Warning Messages
See [Fatal Messages](<h9997.htm#0502>).
