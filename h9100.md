# General component editing
### Data Input
After double clicking on a component from the component tree control a screen similar to the one shown below will be displayed.
![](..\\img\\3dscreen.png)
The input screens are used to set various types of component data, including dimensional data and component configuration data.
NOTE: All the configuration data input will be displayed down the right hand side of the screen, these are represented using drop down lists, and may have an effect on the graphical representations on the rest of the screen.
Some of the data displayed has been transfered from adjoining components and cannot be edited.

# General component error messages
Adjacent comp. | Data required from an adjacent component was unable to be retrieved, check the adjacent component for input errors.  
---|---  
Conflicting diameters | The diameters of the components either side of the weld do not match for the weld type selected, or for a _Fillet welded_ skirt attachment the skirt inside diameter must be greater than the head outside diameter.  
Diameter | An invalid diameter has been input.  
Length | The component length is invalid.  
Location | The location of the adjacent _Circumferential welds_ are invalid or they do not match the direction specified in [Model Orientation](<h9303.htm>). Or for a _Branch component_ the location input is invalid.  
Orientation | An orientation greater than or equal to 360° has been input, or the orientation of the ladder has been input such that it doesn't intersect with the platform.  
Thickness | An invalid thickness has been input.  
Weld | An invalid weld dimension has been input. For a _Fillet welded: Smooth_ or a _Fillet welded: Stepped_ type flange, the external/internal fillet weld is either less than the gap between the _Flange ID_ and the _Shell OD_ or for a Hubbed flange greater than the distance between the _Small end hub diameter_ and the _Shell OD_ , or the internal fillet weld is greater than the _Shell Thk_.
