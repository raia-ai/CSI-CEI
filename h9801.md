# Finglow 2D File commands
## Read or Create an Item
For cloud users wanting to delete lock files. See [Delete lock files](<h9808.htm#0700>).
Item data stored using Finglow Software prior to the March 2020 release will need to be converted into the new file format. See [Convert item data](<h9808.htm#0100>).
From the File menu select **Load/Create Item** or from the Toolbar click on the button ![](..\\img\\filereadcreate.png)
## Load an item
Before any calculations can be performed first _Load an item_ , or _Create a new item_ if one does not exist.
To load the data for an _Item_ , navigate to the required folder select the _Item_ then click on the _Load_ button, or double click on the Item.

## Create a new item
Navigate to the required folder and click the **New item** check box, then enter the **Item name** in the edit box and click the **New item** button.
![](..\\img\\FlatFileNew.png)
A new Item can also be created by using the **Duplicate** option - see [Rename, Delete or Duplicate](<h9808.htm#0400>).
NOTE: There are two different ways the software can display the users data - see [Folders or Drives view](<h9808.htm#0200>).

## Read Input
To read an existing input file: from the File menu select **Read Input** or from the Toolbar click on the button ![](..\\img\\fileread.png)
![](..\\img\\readinp.png)
On the left of the screen the Module currently selected will be shown, highlight the required input file from the list on the right hand side and double click or click on the _Read_ button \(this button will only be active when an input file has been highlighted\).
NOTE: Only input files pertaining to the particular Engineering Module selected will be displayed.
NOTE: When the selected file was saved using a different version of the program the message _Different program version - Check data_ will be displayed. Check the input data to ensure that it is complete before proceeding.
## Save Input
From the File menu select **Save Input** or from the Toolbar click on the button ![](..\\img\\filesave.png)
Use this command to save the currently entered data as an Input data file.
![](..\\img\\saveinp.png)
On the left of the screen the Module currently selected will be displayed, enter the description of the data to be saved in the edit box at the bottom of the screen.
Creating a file with the same name as one that already exists generates the message _Overwrite existing 'File name' ?_ , answer _Yes_ to overwrite the file.
To save the file click on the _Save_ button or double click on a file to be overwritten. 
To rename an existing file, double click on the file name and enter a new description.
NOTE: If the AutoSave option is ON, an input file will automatically be saved each time an Output print file is saved. In this case it will not normally be necessary to save the data separately. To set this option select [Autosave Input](<h8104.htm#0100>).
## Save Output
This command enables the complete calculation to be stored on disk to be collated and printed later in report format using the Format Design Report option. If warning messages occur, the last line of the output may be overridden here. The following options allows the user to specify the name and location of the file to be saved:
From the File menu select **Save Output** or from the Toolbar click on the button ![](..\\img\\fileout.png)
![](..\\img\\saveout.png)
On the left of the screen the Module and Design Code currently selected will be displayed, change the description in the edit box at the bottom of the screen. Click on a highlighted file to change the description.
Creating a file with the same name as one that already exists generates the message _Overwrite existing 'File name' ?_ , answer Yes to overwrite the file.
The description entered should relate to the calculation as it is used to distinguish between multiple outputs from the same module. This description will appear on each page of the printed calculation output.
To save the file click on the _Save_ button or double click on the file to be overwrite. 
If the calculation contained warning messages, a box will appear to allow the user to comment on the messages.

NOTE : The data in the Output files cannot be read back into the Engineering Module. To be able to recover the input data at a later date the Save Input be must used.
NOTE : If the AutoSave option is ON, an Input file will automatically be saved each time an Output file is saved. To set this option [Autosave Input](<h8104.htm#0100>) must be selected.
## Quick Print
From the File menu select **Quick Print** or from the Toolbar click on the button ![](..\\img\\fileprnt.png)
Use this command to print a copy of the current calculation only.
After selecting this option, the software will prompt _Enter Description_ for a description of the calculation in question.

## Convert item data
From the File menu select **Convert item data**. For more details on converting items see [Convert item data](<h9808.htm#0100>)
## Exit command
