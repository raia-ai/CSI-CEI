  1. To import an EFP sheet an _import key_ , of the type _780\#0\#3E9\#40_ , must first be obtained from Finglow.  
  2. From the Finglow CD locate and run the EFP import application _D:\efpMasters\EfpInst.exe_. The input is as follows:  
     * If the _Licence path_ is non standard, enter the correct path.  
     * Clicking on the _Folder_ button will list the available user folders in which to import the EFP Sheets. Select the required path.  
     * Enter the _Installation Code_ provided.  
  3. Click the _Install EFP Sheets_ button. The requested sheets will be imported into project **EFP Masters** and linked automatically.  
  4. Exit the application, or repeat the process for other Data directories or folders.
