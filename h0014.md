# PD 5500 - Cyclic Loading
* * *
# Program Capabilities
This program performs calculations for cycling loading generally in accordance with PD 5500 Annex C. Reference is made to PD 5500 Annex W.6.2.2.3 for the calculation of the stress concentrating effects of nozzles. Stress ranges are assessed using the Reservoir method - see Annex H of [\[36\]](<h9998.htm#0036>).
The program can operate in two modes.
1\. To check the need for a fatigue analysis based on preliminary data.
2\. Perform a fatigue analysis based optionally on pressure, stress or loading data.

# Operation
The data input represents the peaks and troughs of a particular pressure, load or stress cycle as shown in the diagram below.
