# ASME VIII Div.1 - Shells - External Pressure
# Cylindrical or Conical Shells & Heads
* * *
# Program Capabilities
This program performs the calculations for cylindrical and conical shells and formed heads subject to external pressure in accordance with ASME VIII Div.1 clauses UG-28, UG-29, UG-30, UG-33, UG-41\(a\) and Appendix 1 clause 1-8. Factors _A_ and _B_ are evaluated from the figures and tables in ASME II, PART D, Subpart 3.
The joint efficiency _E_ is evaluated by the program in accordance with UW-12 for the types of weld and level of radiography specified.
The calculations assume that the out of roundness of the shell or head complies with the requirements of UG-80 and UG-81.
All shell and head types may be specified by either inside or outside diameter. All thicknesses are entered in the new or as built condition. A thinning allowance may be specified for the shell, head or cone, either as a percentage of the new thickness or as an absolute value in mm or inches. The thinning allowance is always applied to the inside surface. Both internal and external corrosion allowances may be specified as required.
If the external design pressure exceeds the internal design pressure for the shell, head or cone then the user is advised check the thickness using the Shells - Internal Pressure module, with the design pressure set equal to the required external design pressure.

# Operation
## Weld Types and Radiography
Weld types and radiography are specified in the same way as for shells, cones or heads under internal pressure - see [Weld Types](<h0198.htm#0300>) and [Radiography](<h0198.htm#0500>). The diameter and thickness limits are checked as detailed in [Diameter and Thickness Limits](<h0198.htm#0700>).
The calculations also include the additional requirements of UG-28\(g\) for longitudinal lap joints in cylindrical shells or lap joints in spherical shells, and UG-33\(h\) for lap joints in formed heads or longitudinal lap joints in conical shells. When these requirements apply the allowable external pressure is checked against twice the specified design external pressure.
## Joint Efficiency
For all calculations except large and small end reinforcement, the joint efficiency _E_ is taken as 1.0 for butt welded joints in compression \(weld types Seamless, 1, 2 or 3\), regardless of the level of radiography specified - see TABLE UW-12 NOTE.
For lap joints the joint efficiency _E_ is determined from TABLE UW-12 for the specified joint type.
For large and small end reinforcement calculations for cones, the joint efficiency for all weld types is determined from TABLE UW-12 for the specified joint type and radiography, including the requirements of UW-12\(a\) and UW-12\(d\). Since it is not possible to readily determine whether the longitudinal weld is in compression at the cone to cylinder junction - see Appendix 1, clause 1-8\(a\) - the option to take the joint efficiency as 1.0 is not used.
## Cylindrical Shells
For cylindrical shells with or without stiffening rings the program calculates the maximum allowable external working pressure _P_ a in accordance with the requirements of UG-28\(c\) for the effective shell length specified. The minimum required shell thickness for the specified design external pressure is also calculated.
In addition, the program checks the thickness of the shell to UG-27\(c\) or Appendix 1-2 as appropriate, using an internal pressure equal to the specified design external pressure.
For unstiffened shells the effective shell length between End location 1 and End location 2 should be as defined in UG-28\(b\) and shown in FIG. UG-28 or FIG. UG-28.1.
NOTE: When the cylindrical shell is attached to a formed head, a length equal to 1/3 of the inside head height, measured from the tangent line, must be included in the effective length at that end.
If the unstiffened shell thickness is not suitable for the required external pressure it may be necessary to provide one or more stiffening rings. The calculations for the stiffening rings are performed in accordance with UG-29.
Stiffening rings may be either internal or external, and most stiffener types which consist of a combination of rectangular sections may be defined. Only one stiffener may be checked in a single run of the program. If all the stiffeners on the shell are identical, the data should be entered for the section of shell with the longest effective length. If the stiffeners are not identical it will be necessary to perform separate calculations for each stiffener size.
Stiffener positions are specified in terms of a Subject stiffener location \(the one to be analysed\) and the adjacent stiffeners on either side \(Stiffener or end location 1 and Stiffener or end location 2\) which, if not applicable in a particular case, can be located at the ends of the shell. The diagram below shows a typical example of a shell provided with two stiffening rings of identical section but unequally spaced along the shell.
![](..\\img\\stifloc3.png)
Assuming the 'datum' location is at 0, the following data would be entered:
End location 1 | inches | -10.0  
---|---|---  
Stiffener or end locn 1 | inches | -10.0  
Subject stiffener locn  | inches | 100.0  
Stiffener or end locn 2 | inches | 185.0  
End location 2 | inches | 250.0  
The datum point need not necessarily be positioned at the tan-line. On a vertical vessel, for example, the datum point could be at the underside of the base plate.
The required moment of inertia of the combined ring-shell cross section is checked against the available moment of inertia and the maximum permitted unsupported arc length is calculated. The maximum allowable external working pressure is calculated for the longer of the shell sections either side of the subject stiffener \(in the example in above a shell length _L_ of 110 inches would be used\).
## Conical Shells
The program does not cater for cones with a half apex angle exceeding 60°. The Code recommends that such cones are designed as flat plates - see UG-33\(f\)\(2\). The program does not cater for eccentric cones.
The program calculates the maximum allowable external working pressure _P_ a in accordance with the requirements of UG-28\(f\) and \(g\) for the effective length specified. The minimum required cone thickness for the specified design external pressure is also calculated.
In addition, the program checks the thickness of the cone to UG-32\(f\) or \(g\) as appropriate, using an internal pressure equal to the specified design external pressure. Because the thickness calculations for cones are based on thin shell theory, if the design pressure _P_ exceeds 0.385 _SE_ or the thickness exceeds half the inside radius a warning will be given.
For unstiffened cones the axial length _L_ is as defined in UG-33\(b\) and shown in FIG. UG-33.1.
If the unstiffened cone thickness is not suitable for the required external pressure it may be necessary to provide one or more stiffening rings. The calculations for the stiffeners are performed in accordance with UG-29.
Stiffening rings may be either internal or external, and most stiffener types which consist of a combination of rectangular sections may be defined. Only one stiffener may be checked in a single run of the program. If more than one stiffener is required on the cone it will be necessary to perform separate calculations for each stiffener - see [Conical Shells](<h9987.htm>)
The required moment of inertia of the combined ring-cone cross section is checked against the available moment of inertia and the maximum unsupported arc length is calculated. The maximum allowable external working pressure is calculated for both the small end \(Stiffener or end location 2 to Subject stiffener location\) and for the large end \(Subject stiffener location to Stiffener or end location 1\).
### Lines of support
If the cone is attached to a cylindrical shell at the large or small end, the cone may only be analysed separately if the cone to cylinder junctions are considered to act as lines of support satisfying the requirements of Appendix 1-8 - see UG-28\(b\) definition of _L_ , and Code Case 2090, May 1990.
If the cone to cylinder junctions are not considered to act as lines of support the length of the cone should be included with the adjacent cylindrical shell - see FIG. UG-28.1\(a-2\).
See also Code Interpretation VIII-1-10-06 for further guidance on cone to cylinder transitions.
## Large and Small End Reinforcement
It should be noted that unless significant excess thickness is available in the shell and cone a stiffening ring will usually be required.
For the reinforcement calculations an external axial compressive force and/or an external bending moment may also be entered - see Appendix 1-8\(a\) definitions of _f_ 1 and _f_ 2.
For both the large and small end reinforcement of cones without a knuckle at the end being analysed, the Subject stiffener may be located on the shell or the cone, or at the cone to cylinder junction. If a knuckle is present the program will not permit the Subject stiffener to be located on the cone. The Code requires the stiffener to be located within a distance of from the junction - see Appendix 1-8\(b\) and \(c\) - see [Conical Shells](<h9987.htm>)
If the subject stiffener is positioned on the cylindrical shell or at the cone to cylinder junction then, for the calculation of the ring moment of inertia _I_ and the combined moment of inertia _I'_ , the lower flange \(if present\) is assumed to be located entirely on the cylindrical shell. The section of shell which is taken as contributing to the moment of inertia includes the relevant length of cone and shell - see 1-8\(a\), definition of _I'_. If a knuckle is specified this section of shell is assumed to be a plain cylinder \(the curvature of the knuckle is ignored\).
If the subject stiffener is positioned on the cone then the lower flange is assumed to be entirely on the cone, and the section of shell which is taken as contributing to the moment of inertia includes only the relevant length of the cone and not the shell.
The required moment of inertia _I'_ s of the combined ring-shell-cone cross section is checked against the available moment of inertia _I'_. The maximum allowable external working pressures for the shell and for the cone are also checked.
For Large end reinforcement of cones without a knuckle at the large end, if the half apex angle α exceeds the value of Δ from TABLE 1-8.1 then the cross section area of the stiffening ring _A_ s , plus the effective area available in the shell and cone _A_ eL , is checked against the required area of reinforcement _A_ rL.
For Small end reinforcement of cones without a knuckle at the small end the cross section area of the stiffening ring _A_ s , plus the effective area available in the shell and cone _A_ es , is checked against the required area of reinforcement _A_ rs.
If the stiffener allowable stress is lower than that of the shell the required stiffener area is increased accordingly by the factor _k_ \- see Appendix 1-8\(a\) and UG-41\(a\).
## Ellipsoidal Heads
The maximum allowable external working pressure is calculated in accordance with UG-33\(a\)\(1\) and UG-33\(d\). The minimum required head thickness for the specified design external pressure is also calculated.
Because the thickness calculations required by UG-33\(a\)\(1\) are based on thin shell theory, if the design pressure _P_ exceeds 0.385 _SE_ or the thickness exceeds half the inside radius a warning will be given.
## Hemispherical Heads
For spherical shell calculations the hemispherical head option may be selected. The maximum allowable external working pressure is calculated in accordance with UG-33\(c\) and UG-28\(d\). The minimum required head thickness for the specified design external pressure is also calculated.
In addition, the program checks the thickness of the head to UG-32\(e\) or Appendix 1-3 as appropriate, using an internal pressure equal to the specified design external pressure.
## Torispherical Heads
The maximum allowable external working pressure is calculated in accordance with UG-33\(a\)\(1\) and UG-33\(d\). The minimum required head thickness for the specified design external pressure is also calculated.
Because the thickness calculations required by UG-33\(a\)\(1\) are based on thin shell theory, if the design pressure _P_ exceeds 0.385 _SE_ or the thickness exceeds half the inside radius a warning will be given.
## Specification and Attachment of Stiffening Rings
A variety of typical stiffening rings may be specified - see [Specification of Stiffening Rings](<h9990.htm>). Stiffeners may be attached to the shell by a continuous full penetration weld, or by continuous or intermittent fillet welds on both sides - see UG-30\(b\) and FIG. UG-30. If the stiffener includes a lower flange then a fillet weld must be specified. The leg length of fillet welds, the length and spacing of intermittent fillet weld segments and the strength of attachment welds are checked in accordance with UG-30\(c\), \(e\) and \(f\). The allowable stress in the attachment welds is based on the lower of the shell or stiffener allowable stresses, using a joint efficiency of 74% for full penetration welds from UW-15\(c\), and 55% for fillet welds from UW-18\(d\).
## External Pressure Charts
Values for elastic modulus _E_ and factor _B_ are provided automatically by the program for a range of carbon and low alloy steels, austenitic steels and non-ferrous materials from the figures and tables in ASME II, PART D, Subpart 3 - see [External Pressure Charts](<h0198.htm#1100>).

UG-16\(b\): Min thk | The shell, cone or head thickness less corrosion and thinning allowances is less than 1/16" \(1.5mm\) - see UG-16\(b\). NOTE: the exceptions detailed in subparagraphs \(1\) to \(5\) are not checked.  
UG-32\(g\): Knuckle reqd | The cone half apex angle exceeds 30° hence a knuckle is mandatory at the large end, unless the design complies with the requirements of Appendix 1-5\(g\) \(special analysis required\) - see UG-32\(g\).  
Unsuitable for external pressure | The calculated allowable external pressure for the shell, cone or head is less than the specified design external pressure.  
Welded length | For stiffener attachment welds, the length of individual weld segments is less than 2" - see UG-30\(c\).  
## Fatal Warning Messages
See [Fatal Messages](<h9997.htm#0502>).
Bad Xray/Weld selection | An invalid combination of weld type and radiography has been selected.  
---|---  
Corroded failure | A component thickness is less than the corrosion allowance specified.  
Dia and/or thk invalid | A diameter and/or thickness is zero or the thickness exceeds the radius.  
External design pressure | The external design pressure is zero or is too high for a calculation to be performed.  
Half apex angle | The half apex angle exceeds 60° - see UG-33\(f\)\(2\).  
Input | An item of input data has not been entered.  
Inside head height | The inside head height is zero or greater than half the inside diameter.  
Inside knuckle radius | For a torispherical head the inside knuckle radius is zero or exceeds half the inside diameter.  
Inside spherical radius | For a torispherical head the inside spherical radius is less than half the inside diameter.  
Invalid data | A combination of input data is invalid or inconsistent.  
Material | There has been an error getting data from the [Material Database](<h9996.htm>), a more detailed explanation of this error will displayed on the Material Dialog box of the specific material.  
Method failure | Component dimensions are such that the calculation method has failed - see also [Fatal Messages](<h9997.htm#0502>).  
Outside head height | The outside head height is zero or greater than half the outside diameter.  
Ring factor B | The calculated value of factor _B_ for the stiffening ring is greater than the maximum value of _B_ from the applicable material table in ASME II, PART D, Subpart 3 at the design temperature. A larger stiffener should be used.  
Stiffener location | For a conical shell the stiffener is on the knuckle, or for large or small end reinforcement the subject stiffener is on the knuckle.  
Temperature out of range | The design temperature has exceeded the limits for the External Pressure charts in ASME II Part D.  
Thickness | A new or as built thickness is less than the sum of corrosion/tolerance allowances.  
Tolerance | The thickness tolerance is greater than the new or as built thickness.
