# PD 5500 - Shells - Internal Pressure
# Cylindrical or Conical Shells & Heads
* * *
# Program Capabilities
This program performs the calculations for cylindrical and conical shells and formed heads subject to internal pressure in accordance with PD 5500 clause 3.5. Limpet coils are calculated in accordance with clause 3.11.4, note that the limpet coil thickness _e c_ is not calculated.
Standard test pressures are calculated in accordance with 5.8.5.1.
The program also calculates the internal volume and empty weight of the shell, cone or head. The weight and volume for a dished head includes the straight flange \(cylindrical portion\) of the head.
The program calculates Global loads on cylinder to cone junctions in accordance with Annex B.7, no other global loads are considered.

# Operation
## Cylindrical Shells
When the design pressure _p_ does not exceed 0.26 _f_ the required thickness _e_ is calculated in accordance with 3.5.1.2\(a\).
NOTE: When _p_ exceeds 0.26 _f_ the required thickness will give a ratio _D o_/_D i_ greater than 1.3. The mean diameter rules are not necessarily applicable - see 3.2.2 NOTE 1.
## Conical Shells
For conical shells, with or without knuckles, the required thickness of the eccentric or concentric cone is calculated in accordance with 3.5.3. Calculations at the large end and small end junctions are performed in accordance with Annex B.7.
Below is an example of data input for cone locations, one with stiffeners at either end and one without - see also [Conical Shells](<h9987.htm>).

## Ellipsoidal Heads
The required thickness _e_ is calculated in accordance with 3.5.2.3.2. The value of the ratio _e /D_ is obtained from Table 3.5-2 by logarithmic interpolation.
In accordance with the requirements of 3.5.2.2 the required thickness of the cylindrical or straight flange portion of the head is calculated using 3.5.1.2. The required thickness _e_ in the output is the larger of the required thicknesses of the head and the straight flange.
The limitations on head proportions and thickness in 3.5.2.2 are also checked.
## Hemispherical Heads
The required thickness _e_ is calculated in accordance with 3.5.1.2\(b\). The limitations on thickness in 3.5.2.2 are also checked.
## Torispherical Heads
The required thickness _e_ is calculated in accordance with 3.5.2.3.2. The external head height _h_ is calculated using a formula matching that given in the definition of _h_ in 3.5.2.1 using external spherical and knuckle radii _R o_ and _r o_.
![](..\\img\\q0001.png)
In accordance with the requirements of 3.5.2.2 the required thickness of the dished portion of the head and the cylindrical or straight flange portion of the head are calculated using 3.5.1.2. The required thickness _e_ in the output is the larger of the required thicknesses.
The limitations on head proportions and thickness in 3.5.2.2 are also checked.
## Test Conditions
The program calculates the standard shop \(uncorroded\) and site \(corroded\) test pressures _p_ t in accordance with 5.8.5.1, for the location under consideration. The thickness _t_ used is the new thickness. The pressure _p_ includes any liquid static head specified at that location.
Because the actual test pressures to be applied may be controlled by another section of the vessel the program includes a facility to check the actual shop and/or site hydrostatic test conditions by entering the appropriate test pressures under Shop test pressure and Site test pressure - see [Test Pressures](<h0098.htm#0200>).
The specified test pressures are checked against the standard shop and site test pressures calculated by the program. If the specified shop or site test pressure is less than or equal to 1.08 times the corresponding standard test pressure then no check is required and a warning message will be produced.
For ellipsoidal or torispherical heads, the program calculates the maximum allowable working pressure for the head as the lowest value of the allowable working pressures for the knuckle, crown and straight flange portions of the head, using the design strength at room temperature.
