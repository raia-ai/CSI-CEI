# ASME VIII Div.1 - External Loads on Horizontal Vessels
* * *
# Program Capabilities
This program performs the calculations for stresses in horizontal vessels subjected to triaxial loading supported on two saddle supports located either symmetrically or asymmetrically in the longitudinal direction, in accordance with ASME VIII Div.1 Appendix G-6 and G-9 and Stresses in Large Cylindrical Pressure Vessels on Two Saddle Supports by L. P. Zick and additionally to British Standard PD 5500 Appendix G.3.3 with reference to BSI document PD6497. The program considers the effects of accelerated hydrostatic end forces on heads, for simplicity however longitudinal hydrostatic end forces on cones are not considered.
Main areas of application are the analysis of vessels subject to wind shear, vessels sited in earthquake zones and also vessels intended for shipboard operations.
The maximum allowable longitudinal compressive stress for the shell is calculated in accordance with UG-23.
The program calculates the internal volume of the shell and heads in the uncorroded condition, and hence the weight of the liquid contents for a specified liquid level and specific gravity. The membrane stresses due to internal and external pressure are also calculated.
The shell and head may be specified by either inside or outside diameter. All thicknesses are entered in the new or as built condition. Thinning allowances may be specified for the shell and the heads, either as a percentage of the new thickness or as an absolute value in mm or inches. The thinning allowance is always applied to the inside surface. Both internal and external corrosion allowances may be specified as required.
When _Accelerations_ are input the program will calculate the unit force\(s\) due to the mass being accelerated. The subsequent shear forces and bending moments are analysed in three directions.
For the Wind Loading case the longitudinal and transverse accelerations are calculated from the equation _a = Wind Shear / Total Mass_ , the wind shear is then distributed, as in the acceleration case, proportional to the mass. Vessels with unusual mass/wind distribution may require special attention. The vertical acceleration is taken as unity.

# Operation
## Conventions
A maximum of three shell sections, two cone sections and two optional heads may be specified. The validity of the vessel geometry is checked. Saddles and rings must be on one section of the shell or cone; they cannot straddle sections. A typical vessel configuration is detailed in the diagram below. 
![](..\\img\\sadact.png)
When entering location data, any datum can be used, however the vessel must be described from left to right as shown below. Typical input to describe the vessel above, with the datum at the head tangent line, would read as follows:- 
**Head data** |  |  |  | **Comment**  
---|---|---|---|---  
Head | - | No |  | No formed head present  
Location | mm | 9050 |  | Flange face  
**Shell data** |  |  |  |   
Location | mm | 9000 | 7000 | Left edge of shell  
Diameter | mm | 1000 | 2000 |   
**Conical shell data** |  |  |  |   
Location | mm | 8000 |  | Left edge of cone  
**Head data** |  |  |  |   
Head | - | Yes |  | Formed head present  
Location | mm | 0 |  | Tangent line  
Diameter | mm | 2000 |  |   
## Method
The vessel may be subject to triaxial accelerations _X_ , _Y_ and _Z_ resulting in reactions _R_ x, _R_ y and _R_ z acting through the centre of the vessel at the saddle - see the diagram below.
Saddles are considered to be restrained such that translation is only possible at the sliding end in the X direction. Saddles may be asymmetrically located.
When calculating anchor bolt and base plate stresses the effect of the couple due to _F_ z and _R_ z is included with the reaction _R_ y. Reference is made to [Design of Welded Structures \[38\]](<h9998.htm>) page 3.3-9 for the interaction of bolt uplift load and concrete compression.

**Saddle Reactions**
NOTE: Forces and moments are positive in the direction shown, which is relative to the fixed saddle location - see the diagram below.
![](..\\img\\sadaxis.png)
**Saddle Axis**
Shear stresses are calculated by combining the reactions in the Y and Z directions vectorially.
Circumferential stresses on plain saddles are calculated by considering the vertical and lateral bending in the shell. Reference is made to [VBR 11 \[16\]](<h9998.htm>) Section 6.1 for the calculation of factor _K_ z = _K_ 6'. 
Circumferential stresses in saddles with rings are determined by the superposition of the bending stresses due to reactions _R_ z and _R_ y.
Bending stresses in ring type support are calculated using the vectorial addition of the reactions _R_ z and _R_ y.
Longitudinal stresses are calculated by considering the effective shell section at the saddles - see BSI PD6497 Figure 4 which shows the treatment of the effective shell. The diagram below shows the location of the stresses calculated.
Membrane stresses due to internal and/or external pressure are also included.
Where the shell remains circular, longitudinal stress is calculated by combining the moments in the vertical and lateral plane _M_ y and _M_ z vectorially. It should be noted that the location of the resultant stress is not necessarily on a vessel centre line.
The worst combination of tensile and/or compressive stresses are considered in the vicinity of the saddles as shown. The area shown in red is considered to be ineffective.
![](..\\img\\sadstr.png)
The resultant stresses at location A, B and C are as follows:
| Combined stress at A | = Stress 1 | \+ Stress 3 | \+ Stress 4  
---|---|---|---|---  
| Combined stress at B | = Stress 1 | \- Stress 3 | \+ Stress 4  
| Combined stress at C | = Stress 2 | \+ Stress 4 |   
where Stresses 1 to 4 are as defined in Longitudinal Stress Data and Longitudinal Stress Data.
NOTE: linear interpolation of stresses at the saddle and remote from the saddle occurs in the region D to E.
NOTE: the program does not calculate the discontinuity stresses at cone to cylinder junctions. These should be checked using [Shells - Internal Pressure](<h0101.htm>).
## Support Types
The following types of support are covered by the program: 
  * [Plain saddle](<h9988.htm#0010>).  
  * [Internal ring](<h9988.htm#0020>).  
  * [External ring](<h9988.htm#0020>).  
  * [Adjacent internal rings](<h9988.htm#0030>).  
  * [Adjacent external rings](<h9988.htm#0030>).  
  * [Ring support](<h9988.htm#0040>).
All support types may be welded to the shell or loose, except ring supports which are assumed to be welded. Saddle angles from 30° to 180° are permitted by the program, but it should be noted that Appendix G-6 requires the saddle to extend over at least one-third of the circumference of the shell, which is equivalent to a saddle angle of 120°. Saddles outside this range would require careful consideration. This requirement is checked by the program.
## Cylindrical Shell
When the thickness does not exceed half the inside radius _R_ the membrane stresses due to pressure are calculated in accordance with UG-27\(c\). For greater thicknesses Appendix 1-2 is used. In both cases the equations are transposed to give the stress _S_.
## Head Types
The program has the option to consider shells with formed heads as noted in [Saddle & Ring Supports - Dished Heads](<h0104.htm#0230>) or flat heads. The flat head option permits the user to model effects such as heat exchanger tubesheets. The only calculations affected by this selection are shear stresses in the head when the head is located close to the saddle.
## External Pressure
No special analysis of the shell is performed by this module for vessels subject to external pressure. The program will calculate the longitudinal compressive membrane stresses in the shell due to the external pressure.
The shell must be separately checked for the external pressure condition using the [Shells - External Pressure](<h0102.htm>) module. It should be noted that deformation of the shell adjacent to the saddles due to the weight of the vessel and its contents may exceed the permissible out-of-roundness specified in the UG-80. Ring supports are preferable to saddle supports for vacuum vessels.
## Extended Wrapper Plates
If the calculated circumferential stresses in the shell are too high, then they can be reduced by fitting a wrapper plate or wear plate. The width of the wrapper plate should not be less than the saddle width _b_ plus 10 times the shell thickness _t_ , and the wrapper plate must extend a distance _r_ /10 above the horn of the saddle, where _r_ is the mean radius of the shell. The distance _r_ /10 is equivalent to approximately 6°, therefore the wrapper plate angle should be at least equal to the saddle angle θ plus 12°. If the wrapper plate angle exceeds 180° then the calculations will be performed for a wrapper plate angle of 180°. The wrapper plate is normally made the same thickness as the shell.
If a wrapper plate is specified then the minimum required wrapper angle and width will be checked. If either the angle or the width is insufficient the wrapper will be ignored. If both the wrapper angle and width are sufficient then the relevant stresses are calculated in the wrapper at the edge of the saddle, using the combined shell and wrapper thickness, and also in the shell at the edge of the wrapper.
## Stiffening Rings
Additional stiffening of the shell may be provided by means of stiffening rings which may be positioned either externally or internally. The [Specification of Stiffening Rings](<h9990.htm>) is the same as that for in _Shells - External Pressure_ module. The relevant corrosion allowance is deducted from all surfaces of stiffeners.
NOTE: Wrapper plates, as detailed in Extended Wrapper Plates, are not considered to form part of any attached stiffening ring.
When specifying internal or external rings adjacent to the saddles, it is assumed that there is a total of four rings, one either side of each saddle, and that all rings are of the same section. The information entered relates to one of the four identical rings. The distance between the stiffening rings adjacent to each saddle must be greater than the saddle width _b_ 1 plus 10 times the shell thickness _t_ , and less than the shell mean radius _r_ \- see Fig.9 in the Zick paper.
## Ring Type Supports
[Ring support](<h9988.htm#0040>) are used where it is important to ensure that the shell close to the supports remains round. This applies particularly to thin walled vessels which may distort excessively due to the weight of the vessel and contents, and to vessels subject to vacuum.
## Factors
Factors _K_ 1, _K_ 2, _K_ 4, _K_ 5, _K_ 7 and _K_ 8 are calculated in accordance with the equations in the Appendix to the Zick paper. Factor _K_ 3 is evaluated from Fig.7 and factor _K_ 6 is obtained from Table 1 in the Zick paper.
Factors _K_ 10 and _K_ 11 for ring supports are evaluated in accordance with the BSI document PD6497 section 10.
## Calculated and Allowable Stresses
Except as modified to suit asymmetric loading - see Method, stresses are calculated and checked generally in accordance with [Saddle & Ring Supports](<h0104.htm>).
ASME VIII Div.1 UG-23\(d\) allows increased allowable stress intensity values when wind or earthquake loads are included.
