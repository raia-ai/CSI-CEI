# Shells & Heads
## Cylindrical Shells
If the ratio of shell outside diameter to thickness, _e_ / _D_ o, exceeds 0.16 then the equations are not strictly valid and a warning message will be produced - see Clause 7.4.1.
## Conical Shells & Eccentric Conical Shells
Concentric conical shells with or without knuckles at the large and small ends may be specified. If the knuckle radius is zero then the program assumes that no knuckle is present.
The cone geometry may be defined by specifying either the cone half apex angle or alternatively the cone length. Whichever is specified the program will calculate the other dimension.
Eccentric conical shells with or without knuckles at the large and small ends may be specified subject to the limitations given in the Code. If the knuckle radius is zero then the program assumes that no knuckle is present.

## Ellipsoidal Heads
Ellipsoidal heads may be selected as either a standard 2:1 ellipsoidal head where the height of the head \(measured from the tan-line\) is a quarter of the diameter of the head skirt, or a general ellipsoidal head where the head height is specified by the user. For a 2:1 head, if internal dimensions have been specified the inside head height is determined from the inside diameter, and for external dimensions the outside head height is determined from the outside diameter \(all in the uncorroded condition\).
## Hemispherical Heads
Hemispherical heads intended for connection to a cylindrical shell may be selected.
For spherical shells the hemispherical head option may be selected. Please note, however, that the calculated weight and volume will be for a hemispherical head.
## Torispherical Heads
Torispherical heads may be selected as either a standard Korbbogen head, with a crown radius 80% of the head outside diameter and a knuckle radius approximately 15.4% of the outside diameter, or a general torispherical head where the crown and knuckle radii are specified by the user.

# Cladding
The program does not cater for cladding. Cladding is discussed in EN 13445-3 clause 5.5.2.
* * *
# Test Pressures
The option _Check test case \(Menu\)_ has been included to permit the software to perform a check that the test case, if higher than standard, governs the design. In most modules no output is produced if this check is passed. Select _Yes_ to perform a test case assessment generally as above.
For the shop test condition the thickness used is the new thickness less any thinning allowance. Except as noted, the static head effects \(if any\) of the test media should be included in the test pressure. In the test condition a weld joint coefficient of 1.0 is used.
For complex components deflection/distortion, which is not checked, may be the limiting factor.
See [Basis For Determining Test Pressure](<h9997.htm#0350>)
* * *
# Welded Joints
Weld joint coefficients are determined as per EN 13445-3 Clause 5.6. If no governing weld is present select _Seamless_ from the menu _Weld_ and a joint coefficient of 1.0 will be used. The software assumes that all main welded joints are full penetration butt welds, i.e. _Type 1_ or _Type 2_ \- see EN 13445-3 Clause 5.7.

# Testing Groups
As defined in EN 13445-5 Clause 6.
* * *
# Gaskets & Facings
The facing types available in the program correspond to those shown in Table 11.4-1. Gasket factor _m_ and gasket seating stress _y_ are obtain from Annex H Table H.1. In addition, an O-ring groove facing type is available for rubber O-ring joints - see [Facing & Gasket Data](<h9985.htm>). 
NOTE: For facings with a serrated finish, the serration size is not input and is not therefore checked by the program. The user must ensure that the correct facing type is selected. 
See also [Mating flanges and facings](<h9985.htm#0200>) and [Gaskets with Pass partition ribs](<h9985.htm#1000>).

# Bolting
Bolt cross-section areas and recommended clearances are provided automatically by the program. Two bolt tables are currently available: 
  * ISO metric series bolting to BS 3643 Parts 1 and 2 - see [\[12\]](<h9998.htm#0012>). The available bolt sizes range from M3 to M150.  
  * Inch series bolting to BS 1580 Parts 1 and 2 \(in accord with the corresponding sections of ANSI B1.1\) - see [\[4\]](<h9998.htm#0004>) and [\[10\]](<h9998.htm#0010>). The available bolt sizes range from 1/4 inch to 4 inch.
Bolt root areas are evaluated in accordance with 3.8.1.4\(a\) for metric bolting or 3.8.1.4\(b\) for inch series bolting. Data for the bolting is given in [Bolting Data](<h9984.htm>), together with an explanation of the methods used to calculate the root areas of the bolts. 
NOTE: The program covers a more extensive range of bolt sizes than that shown in Table 3.8-2. 
Recommended minimum clearances are based on TEMA TABLE D-5 ref. [\[26\]](<h9998.htm#0026>). 
In addition to the standard bolt tables a _User defined_ option is available to enable the user to enter specific values for the following items of data: 
  * Diameter  
  * Bolt area  
  * Minimum bolt pitch  
  * Minimum edge clearance  
  * Minimum hub clearance
For the requirements of 11.4.3.1, small bolts are defined as having a diameter 12mm or less. 
* * *
# Cast Component
For cast components select _Yes_ from the menu, the software will select the appropriate values from EN 13445-3 Table 6-1.
* * *
Yield strength and Tensile strength The minimum tensile strength _R m_ for the material at room temperature, should be entered as given in EN 13445-2. The specified minimum yield strength _R p 0.2_ \(0.2% proof stress\) for the material at room temperature should be entered as given EN 13445-2. The specified minimum yield strength _R p 1.0_ \(1.0% proof stress\) for the material at room temperature should be entered as given EN 13445-2. Generally only required for austenitc steels. The tensile strength _R m/T_ for the material at the design temperature, should be entered as given in EN 13445-2. Generally only required for austenitc steels. The yield strength _R p 0.2/T_ for the material at the design temperature should be entered as given EN 13445-2. The yield strength _R p 1.0/T_ for the material at the design temperature should be entered as given EN 13445-2. Generally only required for austenitc steels.
