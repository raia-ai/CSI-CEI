# Finglow Model 3D view

From the Toolbar press the ![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/3ddraw.png) button, this will display the current item as a 3D model in a separate window. Below is a list of actions that can be selected from the Toolbar displayed in this window.

| **Button**                                                         | **Action**                                                                                                                      |
