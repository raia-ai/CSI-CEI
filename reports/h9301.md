# Change component colour

This dialog allows the user to change the colour of each component drawn by the software. The colour for each component can be defined for the _Internal_ and _External_ surface. NOTE some components do not have an Internal surface so this colour will be ignored. ![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/3dcolour.png) To change the colour of a specific component click in the requied column for that component and the following screen will be displayed. ![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/3dcolour2.png) Click the **Save** button to save any changes made. NOTE By clicking the **Default Settings** button all colour's will be restored to those set by Finglow.
