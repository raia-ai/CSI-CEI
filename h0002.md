# PD 5500 - Shells - External Pressure
# Cylindrical or Conical Shells & Heads
* * *
# Program Capabilities
This program performs the calculations for cylindrical and conical shells and formed heads subject to external pressure in accordance with PD 5500 Section 3.6.
If the external design pressure exceeds the internal design pressure for the shell, head or cone then the user is advised to check the thickness using the _Shells - Internal Pressure_ module, with the design pressure set equal to the required external design pressure.
The calculations assume that the out of roundness of the shell or head complies with the requirements of PD 5500. If the out of roundness of a cylindrical shell exceeds the permitted tolerance then the allowable external pressure may be estimated by the procedure given in Annex M. An EFP sheet is available for performing this additional calculation.

# Operation
## Cylindrical Shells
For cylindrical shells with or without stiffening rings the program calculates the maximum allowable external working pressure _p_ in accordance with the requirements of 3.6.2.1 for the effective shell length.
For unstiffened shells the effective shell length between End location 1 and End location 2 should be as shown in Figure 3.6-1 and Table 3.6-2
NOTE 1: When the cylindrical shell is attached to a formed head, a length equal to 40% of the inside head height, measured from the tangent line, must be included in the effective length at that end.
NOTE 2: When the cylindrical shell is attached to a cone with a half apex angle less than 30° the effective length must include the axial length of the cone - see Cone to Cylinder Intersections.
If the unstiffened shell thickness is not suitable for the required external pressure it may be necessary to provide one or more stiffening rings. The calculations for the stiffening rings are performed in accordance with 3.6.2.3.1 _Light Stiffeners_. The proportions of the stiffening rings are checked in accordance with 3.6.2.2 \(a\) & \(b\).
Stiffening rings may be either internal or external, and most stiffener types which consist of a combination of rectangular sections may be defined.
Stiffener positions are specified in terms of a Subject stiffener location \(the one to be analysed\) and the adjacent stiffeners on either side \(Stiffener or end location 1 and Stiffener or end location 2\) which, if not applicable in a particular case, can be located at the ends of the shell. The Diagram below shows a typical example of a shell provided with two stiffening rings of identical section but unequally spaced along the shell.
For jacketted vessels, note the additional requirements of 3.11.2.3 \(c\)\(3\).
![](..\\img\\stifloc1.png)
Assuming the 'datum' location is at 0, the following data would be entered:
End location 1 | mm | -250.0  
---|---|---  
Stiffener or end locn 1 | mm | -250.0  
Subject stiffener locn  | mm | 2500.0  
Stiffener or end locn 2 | mm | 4600.0  
End location 2 | mm | 6350.0  
The datum point need not necessarily be positioned at the tan-line. On a vertical vessel, for example, the datum point could be at the underside of the base plate.
Only one stiffener may be checked in a single run of the program. If all the stiffeners on the shell are identical, the data should be entered for the section of shell with the longest effective length. If the stiffeners are not identical it will be necessary to perform separate calculations for each stiffener size or location.
The elastic instability pressure _p n_ of the stiffened cylinder, and the _Stress_ _sigma_ are calculated for values of _n_ equal to 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, and are checked against the allowable values specified in the Code. The maximum allowable external working pressure is calculated for the longer of the shell sections either side of the subject stiffener \(in the example above a shell length _L_ of 2750 mm would be calculated by the program\).
## Conical Shells
The program does not cater for cones with a half apex angle exceeding 75°- see 3.6.3.
NOTE: If the cone is attached to a cylindrical shell at the large end, the cone may only be analysed separately if the cone to cylinder junction is considered to act as a plane of substantial support. If the cone to cylinder junction is not considered to act as plane of substantial support the length of the cone should be included with the adjacent cylindrical shell - see Figure 3.6-1.
NOTE: 3.6.3.2.1 does not cover cones with internal stiffeners hence results should be treated as informative only.
The program calculates the maximum allowable external working pressure _p_ in accordance with the requirements of 3.6.3.1 for the effective length specified. For unstiffened cones the axial length _L_ is as shown in Figure 3.6-8 \(a\).
If the unstiffened cone thickness is not suitable for the required external pressure it may be necessary to provide one or more stiffening rings. The calculations for the stiffeners are performed in accordance with 3.6.3.2.
Stiffeners are assessed in accordance with 3.6.3.2.2. - see [Conical Shells](<h9987.htm>)
The elastic instability pressure _p n_ of the stiffened cone, and the stress σ are calculated for values of _n_ equal to 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, and are checked against the allowable values specified in 3.6.2.3.1.2\(a\) and \(c\). The maximum allowable external working pressure is calculated for both the small end \(Stiffener or end location 2 to Subject stiffener location\) and for the large end \(Subject stiffener location to Stiffener or end location 1\).
NOTE: The _Shells - Internal Pressure_ module should be run in order to check the geometrical limitations.
Cone to Cylinder Intersections The cone to cylinder intersection at the large end of a cone may be considered as a plane of substantial support provided that the requirements of section 3.6.3.3.1 are met. If these requirements are not met then the effective length _L_ of the cylindrical shell should include the axial length of the attached cone. For the cone to cylinder intersection at the end of a cone additional thickening or local stiffening may be necessary, this calculation is beyond the scope of this module - see section 3.6.3.3.2 and 3.6.3.3.3. Ellipsoidal Heads The maximum allowable external working pressure _p_ is calculated in accordance with section 3.6.4 as a spherical shell of mean radius _R_ equal to _D_ 2 _/_ 4 _h_ \- see 3.6.7. Hemispherical Heads The maximum allowable external working pressure _p_ is calculated in accordance with section 3.6.5. Torispherical Heads The maximum allowable external working pressure _p_ is calculated in accordance with section 3.6.4 as a spherical shell of mean radius _R_ equal to the external crown radius - see section 3.6.6. Specification and Attachment of Stiffening Rings A variety of typical stiffening rings may be specified - see [Specification of Stiffening Rings](<h9990.htm>). Stiffeners may be attached to the shell by a continuous full penetration weld, or by continuous or intermittent fillet welds on both sides. If the stiffener includes a lower flange then a fillet weld must be specified. Weld sizes are not checked by the program. External Pressure Test When a vessel is to be subject to an external pressure test an additional design case should be considered in accordance with 5.8.5.2\(b\). The External design pressure should taken as 0.8 times the external test pressure, the design temperature, design strength and corrosion allowances should be the values applicable for the test condition.
