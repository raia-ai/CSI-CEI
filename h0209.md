# EN 13445 - Fixed Tubesheets
* * *
# Program Capabilities
The program can analyse the effects of pressure and differential thermal expansion on a fixed tubesheet exchanger, generally in accordance with EN 13445 Clause 13.5.
The exchanger comprises a shell, optionally fitted with a shell expansion bellows, a tube bundle and two equal tubesheets.
The program has a Design Option to determine the minimum required thickness of the tubesheet.
Code limitations are checked in accordance with EN 13445 Clause 13.5.2.
* * *
# Operation
The program analyses the following:- 
  * Shell: Tensile and compressive longitudinal stresses due to pressure and differential thermal expansion. Circumferential stress due to pressure. Note: the External Pressure module should be used for a full analysis of shells subject to external pressure.  
  * Tubes: Tensile and compressive longitudinal stresses due to pressure and thermal expansion. Circumferential membrane stress due to pressure, tubes are not checked for collapse due to external pressure.  
  * Tubesheet: Bending and shear stresses due to pressure and thermal expansion, additionally edge bending due to bolting, if applicable.  
  * Tube/Tubesheet joints: Tube end loads due to pressure, thermal expansion and tubesheet support.
Examples of various exchanger configurations are detailed in the diagrams below - see [Channel-TS-Shell Connections](<h9989.htm#0100>).

## Design Conditions
The program can handle five design conditions simultaneously. Additional conditions can be handled by repeated use of the program. The type of condition under consideration may be specified as new or corroded, design or test:
_New:Des_  
_Cor:Des_  
_New:Tst_  
_Cor:Tst_  
The program does not consider differential design conditions which will require agreement between the Manufacturer and the End User.
## Tube End Types
Tube end types may be specified as per Clause 13.7 and 13.12:
| _Strength weld_ |   
---|---|---  
| _Seal weld_ |   
| _Expand & strength weld_ |   
| _Expand & seal weld_ |   
| _Expand only_ |   
| _Explosion bonded_ |   
For expanded tube ends, the number of tube hole grooves may be specified as: _None, Single_ or _Double_ that is 2 or more.
## Metal Temperatures
See [Metal Temperatures](<h9997.htm#0800>).
TEMA T-4.3 contains a more rigorous calculation of mean metal temperatures which may be input if required.
## Corrosion
Corrosion allowances may be specified for both internal and external surfaces of the shell and channel, as required.
Corrosion allowances for the tubesheet may be specified for the shellside and the tubeside.
For new or as built conditions any input corrosion allowances will be ignored.
NOTE: Corrosion is not applied to tube surfaces, as these are normally considered as consumables. If corrosion is required then the corroded tube dimensions should be input.
## Gaskets & Facings
See [Gaskets & Facings](<h0298.htm#0550>). 
## Bolting
See [Bolting](<h0298.htm#0600>) and [Bolting Data](<h9984.htm>).
