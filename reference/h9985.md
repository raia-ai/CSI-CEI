# Facing & Gasket Data

## Facing & Gasket Data

### Standard T.1a/b

The facing may be specified as _Raised_ , _Flat_ or _Recessed_. If a raised face is specified, the program assumes that the facing diameter on the mating flange is not less than that on the flange under consideration. This facing may be smooth or serrated. The program assumes that the serrations do not exceed 1/64 inch deep and 1/32 inch wide as specified in ASME VIII Div.1 TABLE 2-5.2 NOTE (1). If the serrations exceed these limits then facing _Standard_ _T.4_ or _Standard_ _T.5_ should be selected. ![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/ftype1.png)

### Standard T.1c/d

The facing may be specified as _Raised_ or _Recessed_. This facing may be smooth or serrated. The program assumes that the serrations do not exceed 1/64 inch deep and 1/32 inch wide as specified in ASME VIII Div.1 TABLE 2-5.2 NOTE (1). If the serrations exceed these limits then facing _Type 4_ or _Type 5_ should be selected. NOTE: For facing types 1c and 1d the facing width must not exceed the gasket width - see ASME VIII Div.1 TABLE 2-5.2. This is checked by the program. ![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/ftypetg.png)

### Standard T.2 and T.3

These facings are always _Raised_. The program assumes that the nubbin height is 1/64 inch as specified in ASME VIII Div.1 TABLE 2-5.2. For a height exceeding 1/64 inch, facing _Tongue & Groove T.1c/d_ should be selected. NOTE: For facing types 2 and 3 the facing width must not exceed half the gasket width - see ASME VIII Div.1 TABLE 2-5.2. This is checked by the program. ![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/ftype2.png)

### Standard T.4

The facing may be specified as _Raised_ , _Flat_ or _Recessed_. If a raised face is specified, the program assumes that the facing diameter on the mating flange is not less than that on the flange under consideration. This facing may be smooth or serrated. The program assumes that the serrations exceed 1/64 inch deep or 1/32 inch wide as specified in ASME VIII Div.1 TABLE 2-5.2 NOTE (1). If the serrations do not exceed these limits then facing _Standard T.1a/b_ or _Tongue & Groove T.1c/d_ must be selected. ![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/ftype4.png)

### Standard T.5

The facing may be specified as _Raised_ , _Flat_ or _Recessed_. If a raised face is specified, the program assumes that the facing diameter on the mating flange is not less than that on the flange under consideration. This facing may be smooth or serrated. The program assumes that the serrations exceed 1/64 inch deep or 1/32 inch wide as specified in ASME VIII Div.1 TABLE 2-5.2 NOTE (1). If the serrations do not exceed these limits then facing _Standard T.1a/b_ or _Tongue & Groove T.1c/d_ must be selected. ![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/ftype5.png)

### Ring type T.6

This facing is always _Recessed_ and is used for solid metal ring type joint (RTJ) gaskets. ![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/ftype6.png)

### O-ring

This facing may be _Flat_ or _Recessed_ and is used for self-energising O-rings and square or T-section rings. ![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/ftypeor.png)

### Full Faced

For butt welded and fillet welded flanges this facing must be specified when the gasket contact area extends outside the circle enclosing the bolts - see PD 5500 Section 3.8.4 and EN-13445 Section 11.6. For lap joint flanges this facing should be specified when the gasket contact width straddles the mean diameter of the contact face between the lap and the loose backing flange. ![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/ftypeff.png)

### Metal to Metal

This facing must be specified for full face flanges with metal to metal contact both inside and outside the bolt circle see PD 5500 Section 3.8.8 and EN-13445 Section 11.10. ![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/ftypemm.png) The following Facing options are available in the Finglow Software.

| i        | Full faced      | Flat                              | Flat                           |
| j        | Metal to metal  | Flat                              | Flat                           |

### Mating flanges and facings

To correctly calculate the gasket contact width data relating to the mating facing is input. Any corrosion applied to the subject flange or cover will be assumed to apply to the mating flange. If the mating flange is a tubesheet or flat cover then mating flange ID may be entered as zero.

### Facings with Internally Confined Gaskets

The following Facing options are available for internally confined gaskets in the Finglow Software. Either facing type is considered to mate with a _Recessed_ facing. ![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/ftypeconf.png)

### A typical tubesheet gasket confing

![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/ts_edge.png) This is typical of a fully confined gasket as shown in TEMA R-6.5 and FIGURE F-3 [\[26\]](../h9998.htm#0026). The machining allowances to be deducted from the new tubesheet, flat cover or flange thickness. Dimensions A & D show the confining heights. The confining height will also be the depth of any tubeside pass partition groove. Dimensions B & C show the raised facing heights. **NOTE:** The software will deduct the facing height and confining height from each side of the tubesheet as applicable. If external corrosion is a factor, this will be added by the software. The remaining thickness will be used to check edge bolting and bending calculations.

### Gasket types and permitted facing types

The following is a list of _Gasket types_ with their complete description from the appropriate design codes and the permitted facing types for each material. The user is advised to review the comments on the tables referenced.

### Gasket database

The gasket and its calculation data is selected from the gasket database, the list is restricted to the _Gasket type_ previously selected. The availability of data for the required _Calculation method_ is indicated by a check mark. The user may enter other calculation data by selecting a _User defined_ gasket. ![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/GaskDlg.png) The calculation data and its source, for the gasket selection and the required calculation method is displayed at the bottom of the screen. The gasket data required for the standard flange calculation method is obtained from ASME VIII Div.1 Table 2-5.1, ASME VIII Div.2 Table 4.16.1, PD 5500 Table 3.8-4 or EN 13445 Annex H as applicable. The user may wish to review the comments on those tables. The data required for the alternative flange calculation method is obtained from BS EN 1591-2 Tables 2 to 30 or EN 13445-3 Annex G Tables G.9-1 to G.9-6 as applicable.

## Gaskets with Pass partition ribs

The presence of a pass partition plate will increase the bolt loads required by the gasket load calculation and should be considered. The software follows the guidance given in TEMA, Section 5, RCB-11.7 [\[26\]](../h9998.htm#0026), if the user answers _Yes_ to the _Pass partition_ question and inputs the total length _r l_ of pass partition ribs that compress the gasket. For simplicity it is assumed that the effective pass partition width _b r_, the gasket factors _m'_ and _Y'_ are the same as _b_ , _m_ and _Y_ for the peripheral portion of the gasket. If this is not the case then the effective pass partition length can be adjusted accordingly. For a U-tube or two pass heat exchanger the pass partition length would typically be equal to the gasket inside diameter.
