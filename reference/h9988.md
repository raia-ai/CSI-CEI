# Saddle Types

## Saddle Types

### Plain Saddle

Standard saddle support, typically extending over about one third of the circumference of the shell. ![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/saddle.png)

### Internal and External Rings

Standard saddle support with a stiffening ring fitted inside or outside the shell, in the plane of the saddle. ![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/sadring3.png)

### Internal and External Adjacent Rings

Standard saddle support with stiffening rings fitted inside or outside the shell, either side of each saddle, where _y_ is the _Distance between rings_. ![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/sadring2.png)

### Ring Support

Vessel supported on external rings. ![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/sadring.png)

## Saddle base details

![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/sadrib.png) ![](https://github.com/raia-ai/CSI-CEI/blob/img/sadbase.png) Anchor bolt loading and base plate stresses are calculated generally in accordance with [DVHS \[21\]](../h9998.htm#0021) sheet D1302. To limit excessive deflections in austenitic stainless steel base plates the material yield value for 0.2% proof stress is used.
