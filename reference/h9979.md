# FSE Calculation
The software has the ability to perform stress calculations on a Flexible Shell Element using the method in TEMA RCB-8. The software will check the stresses at a maximum of 12 different SCL's \(Stress Classification Lines\) arround the joint as per TEMA Figure RCB-8.6.2, depending on the geometry input. These stresses will be calculated using the loading cases defined in Table 4.18.7 and Table 4.18.9 and the maximum stress will be displayed and checked by the software. Allowable stresses are calulated in accordance with Table 4.18.5. All flexible shell elements are assumed to be symetric. 
## Data Input

The following dimensions may be input as decribed below: 
  * **Te** \- The flexible element thickness.  
  * **ID** \- The maximum Inside diameter of the shell element.  
  * **Lo** \- Outer straight length \(this can be left as zero\).  
  * **Li** \- Exchanger shell length \(this can be left as zero\).  
  * **Ra** \- Inner torus radius \(this can be left as zero\).  
  * **Rb** \- Outer torus radius \(this can be left as zero\).
  * **Fa** \- Inner straight flange length \(this can be left as zero\).
  * **Fb** \- Outer straight flange length \(this can be left as zero\).
  * **To** \- Outer thickness \(this can be left as zero\).
  * **Ts** \- Exchanger shell thickness \(this can be left as zero\).
