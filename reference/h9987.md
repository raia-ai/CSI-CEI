# Conical Shells

Conical shells with or without knuckles at the large and small ends may be specified. If the knuckle radius is zero then the program assumes that no knuckle is present. Two thicknesses are input for each end of the cone, _Small end new cone thk_ and _Large end new cone thk_ ; the _Small end new cone thk_ is assumed to be local to the small end cone/cylinder junction, the _Large end new cone thk_ is assumed to extend over the greater portion of the cone's length. Stiffening rings may be either internal or external, and most stiffener types which consist of a combination of rectangular sections may be defined - see [Specification of Stiffening Rings](../h9990.htm). Stiffener positions are specified in terms of a _Subject stiffener location_ (the one to be analysed) and the adjacent stiffeners on either side (_Stiffener or end location 1_ and _Stiffener or end location 2_) which may be the ends of the cone.

| The datum point need not necessarily be positioned as shown. The program will check that the stiffener positions are valid. If a large end or small end knuckle radius has been entered the program will also check whether any of the stiffeners are positioned on the knuckles. |                      |                      |
