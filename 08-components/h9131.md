# Shell bellow data
## Data Input
Description | Enter the shell bellow description.  
---|---  
Diameter: OD-ID-NB | Select option for input of shell bellow diameter as _Nominal bore_ , _External_ or _Internal_. For standard pipe sizes to ANSI B36.10 or BS 1600 select _Nominal bore_ \- see [Nominal Pipe Sizes & Schedules](<h9986.htm>). For other diameters and/or thicknesses select _External_ or _Internal_ \- see [\[5\]](<h9998.htm#0005>) and [\[11\]](<h9998.htm#0011>).  
Stiff bellows | Select _No_ if the shell bellows is not subject to corrosion, i.e. the spring rate in the new and corroded conditions are essentially the same.  
Quantity | Enter the quantity of convolutions, **NOTE:** this is only used for drawing.  
Pitch | Enter the pitch between convolutions, **NOTE:** this is only used for drawing.  
Spring rate | Spring rate of shell bellows unit defined as force per unit deflection. For thin walled bellows a value of zero may be entered, alternatively the program will use TEMA [\[26\]](<h9998.htm#0026>) to determine if the spring rate classifies the bellow as thin walled. In the absence of a specified value the spring rate may be calculated using the Standards of the Expansion Joint Manufacturers Association section C-5.2. Or alternatively using the FSE calculation method in the software, firstly run the FSE calculation to get the spring rate then input this in the bellow design and run the calculation again - see [FSE Calculation](<h9979.htm#0010>)  
Spring rate new | Spring rate of a _stiff_ shell bellows unit defined as force per unit deflection, in the new and uncorroded condition.  
Shell bellows Material | Shell bellows material selection from the [Material Database](<h9996.htm>).  
## Additional Information
If a Flexible shell element calculation is going to be performed then data should be input as per [FSE Calculation](<h9979.htm#0010>), otherwise the FSE data can be left as zero. See also [FSE Calculation](<h9133.htm#0901>)
## Error Messages
See also [General component error messages](<h9100.htm#1000>).
Diameter | The _Maximum bellow ID_ must be greater than the _Bellow OD_.  
---|---  
Length | The pitch specified is invalid.
